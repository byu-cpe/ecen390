# ECEN 390 - Laser Tag Project

## Class Overview

In this course you will construct a complex, multi-player laser-tag system that will help to integrate your knowledge and experience from the other three Junior-Core courses:

  - ECEN 340 (Analog Circuit Design),
  - ECEN 380 (Signal Processing), and
  - ECEN 330 (Programming Embedded Systems).

The theories, concepts and lab exercises from these three courses combine to complete an entire system. The analog designs from ECEN 340 provide the shot-firing LED, shot-detecting photodiode and associated analog electronics. The theories and algorithms that you learned about in ECEN 380 provide the signal processing necessary to detect **when** a player has been shot and also to determine **which** player was the shooter. Finally, the programming exercises and embedded system experience from ECEn 330 will help you write the necessary 'C' code to create a final working system.

The process of creating the laser-tag system is broken into several milestones. This helps students to schedule their effort and to focus on specific portions of the system during implementation.
