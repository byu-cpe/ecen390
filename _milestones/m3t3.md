## Overview

In this task you will finish implementing the receive path of your
laser-tag system, which includes a circular buffer and a hit detector.
The filter component of the receive path was implemented in Milestone 3,
Task 1. An implementation of the receiver (rx) driver is provided for
you. The receiver driver interacts with the ADC, which digitizes the
amplified signal coming from the photodiode on your analog board.
Additionally, you will implement a shot component that will keep track
of the number of shots remaining. You will test each of these components
with provided test code to verify correct operation. In a later
milestone, you will be guided how to connect these components in a
complete laser-tag system.

### Components

1.  **Circular Buffer:** this buffer stores values digitized by the ADC.
1.  **Receiver Driver:** this driver digitizes an incoming analog signal
    and places the samples in the circular buffer.
1.  **Hit Detector:** this detector takes the current energy for
    each channel coming from the filter component and detects if a hit
    is present.
1.  **Shot Counter:** this counter keeps track of the number of shots
    remaining.

## Implementation

### Circular Buffer

#### Specification

  - Only use integer types (uint16\_t, uint32\_t, int16\_t, etc.)
    in the implementation. **DO NOT** use float or double types\!
  - The buffer is cleared of any elements with `buffer_init()`.
  - When adding a value to the buffer, the oldest value is overwritten
    if the buffer is full.
  - When reading a value from the buffer, zero is returned if the
    buffer is empty.
  - The capacity of the buffer in elements is returned with
    `buffer_size()`.
  - The number of elements stored in the buffer is returned with
    `buffer_elements()`.

#### Detail

Implement a circular buffer in buffer.c that is dedicated to storing
incoming **integer** data of type `buffer_data_t`.

A sketch is given below as a starting point for an implementation of
buffer.c. You will need to finish the implementation. See this
[circular buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
article for implementation help.

```c
#include "buffer.h"

#define BUFFER_SIZE 16384

typedef struct {
    uint32_t indexIn; // Points to the next open slot.
    uint32_t indexOut; // Points to the next element to be removed.
    uint32_t elementCount; // Number of elements in the buffer.
    buffer_data_t data[BUFFER_SIZE]; // Values are stored here.
} buffer_t;

volatile static buffer_t buf;

// Functions...
```

{: .warning }
Do not implement the buffer component by shifting values in the data
array. It will be too slow!

### Hit Detector

#### Specification

  - When the detector is first initialized, all channels are considered
    for hits. Assume the filter module is initialized previously.
  - Frequency channels are ignored for hit detection if the corresponding
    element of a channel array is marked false when passed as an
    argument to `detector_setChannels()`.
  - All channels are ignored if a global ignore-hit-flag is set with a
    call to `detector_ignoreAllHits(true)`. This is useful during periods
    of invincibility or during a lockout after a previous hit.
  - When a hit is detected, a global hit flag will be set and a global
    channel number will be set. These values can be retrieved with
    `detector_getHit()` and `detector_getHitChannel()`.
  - Once a hit is detected, no more hits can be detected until
    `detector_clearHit()` is called.
  - Hit detection is skipped if the ignore-hit-flag is set or if a
    previous hit has not been cleared.

#### Detail

#### Detecting "Hits"

Having completed the filter component, you have code that can compute
the total energy that passes through each of your IIR-based bandpass
filters. Now what? Here are some considerations.

1.  You could always select the bandpass filter output that contains
    the maximum energy relative to the others. Unfortunately this simple
    scheme won't work because it would always detect a "hit" of some
    sort, even when no one is shooting at you. Due to various noise
    sources, there will always be some energy in at least some of the
    frequencies, even when no one is shooting at you.
1.  You could select the frequency that contains an energy value that is
    above some threshold. This "kind of" works; however, it is difficult
    or impossible to come up with a threshold that works in enough
    situations. For example, let's say you perform some experiments in
    indoor light with the two tag units spaced apart by about 10 feet.
    At this distance, you set the threshold so that "hits" are only
    detected when the computed energy is above the threshold. OK so far.
    Now you move the tag units so that they are 20-feet apart. Now, when
    you press the trigger, nothing happens because the energy numbers
    across all frequencies are not above the threshold. You can lower
    the threshold to increase sensitivity and detect "hits" at greater
    distances. However, at some point you will begin to detect noise
    (from your amplifier circuitry, from the ambient lighting, etc.) as
    a "hit". Clearly, just comparing the energy in the bandpass filter
    outputs to a **fixed** threshold won't work very well.

#### A Hit-Detection Algorithm

We will use an algorithm that adjusts the threshold based upon the
current energy contained in the outputs from all 10 bandpass filters.

The detection algorithm consists of the following steps:

1.  After running all of the filters and computing the energy for each
    bandpass filter output, sort the energy values in **ascending** order
    according to their magnitude. Just use a [selection
    sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) or an [insertion
    sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) algorithm to do
    the sorting.
1.  Select the [median value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median).
    Selecting the median value is simple once you have sorted the energy
    values -- the median value is simply the value "in the middle" of
    the set of sorted values. For our system, we have 10 energy values;
    once they are sorted in ascending order, the median value is either
    the 5th or 6th element according to the sorted order. **Everyone
    should sort values in ascending order and select the 5th value
    ('C' array index 4) for consistency.**
1.  Multiply the median value with a factor to compute a
    threshold. This computed threshold should be high enough to reject
    noise and avoid false "hits" but should be low enough to detect hits
    from a distance of 40 feet or so. You will compute a default threshold
    factor through experimentation in Milestone 4. Why use a threshold
    factor? Because it can adjust for the different sensitivities in
    everyone's analog board.
1.  Find the bandpass filter that contains the maximum energy (this is
    easy to do once you have sorted the values). If the maximum energy
    exceeds the threshold (median_value \* threshold_factor), you have
    detected a hit.

{: .note }
*Pro Tip: When sorting energy values, sort a separate array containing
the indices of the original array.* If you sort the energy values
themselves, you will not know what frequency channel the value
originally came from. Comparing the high energy value with an unsorted
copy of the energy values to find the channel doesn't work either, so
don't try it. Below is a sketch of a custom sort function that sorts
the index array and not the energy values.

```c
// Sort the indices idx[] that reference array s[] in ascending order.
// Does not modify s[].
// idx[] and s[] are of length n.
static void sort(uint16_t idx[], filter_data_t s[], uint32_t n)
{
}
```

After the sort, you can identify the median energy channel with
`idx[4]` and the median energy value with `energy[idx[4]]`.

#### Hit-Detection Algorithm Example

Here is an example of the hit-detection algorithm in operation. Assume
the threshold factor = 5. Let's say that we retrieve the current energy
values for all 10 frequencies using the previously-implemented function:
`filter_getEnergyArray()`. The retrieved energy values for the 10
frequencies for this example are:

  - energy\[0\]: 150
  - energy\[1\]: 20
  - energy\[2\]: 40
  - energy\[3\]: 10
  - energy\[4\]: 15
  - energy\[5\]: 30
  - energy\[6\]: 35
  - energy\[7\]: 15
  - energy\[8\]: 25
  - energy\[9\]: 80

After sorting in ascending order, we get the following:

  - energy\[3\]: 10 (\#1)
  - energy\[7\]: 15 (\#2)
  - energy\[4\]: 15 (\#3)
  - energy\[1\]: 20 (\#4)
  - energy\[8\]: 25 (\#5)
  - energy\[5\]: 30 (\#6)
  - energy\[6\]: 35 (\#7)
  - energy\[2\]: 40 (\#8)
  - energy\[9\]: 80 (\#9)
  - energy\[0\]: 150 (\#10)

The median value (sorted element \#5) is 25 from the bandpass filter
for frequency 8. For this example, that would mean that you would only
detect hits for values that are over the threshold value of
25 (median value) \* 5 (threshold factor) = 125. The bandpass filter for
frequency 0 has the maximum energy value (150) which is greater than 125
so we would detect a hit.

Let's run the detector again with another set of data. After sorting,
the energy values from the bandpass filter outputs are as follows:

  - energy\[2\]: 10 (\#1)
  - energy\[1\]: 25 (\#2)
  - energy\[4\]: 30 (\#3)
  - energy\[7\]: 30 (\#4)
  - energy\[8\]: 45 (\#5)
  - energy\[6\]: 50 (\#6)
  - energy\[5\]: 55 (\#7)
  - energy\[3\]: 65 (\#8)
  - energy\[9\]: 70 (\#9)
  - energy\[0\]: 150 (\#10)

Our median value (element \#5 in sorted order) = 45. We compute the new
threshold by multiplying 45 \* 5 (threshold factor) = 225. Our maximum
energy value (150) is less than our computed threshold (225) so no hit is
detected. The reason no hit is detected is because the maximum energy is
not sufficiently greater than the energy contained in the outputs of the
other bandpass filters.

{: .note }
These numbers are provided solely for example. The actual numbers you
will encounter in your system will be quite different.

#### Receive Path

A function is needed that ties all the components of the receive path
together. These components are the receiver driver, the filter stages,
and the hit detector. The `detector_run()` function will implement the
receive path.

When you invoke `detector_run()`, perform the following steps:

1.  Query the ADC receive buffer to determine how many elements it
    contains. Use `rx_get_count()` for this. Call this amount `adc_cnt`.
1.  Now, repeat the following steps `adc_cnt` times.
      - Get a sample from the ADC receive buffer using `rx_get_sample()`.
        Place this value in a variable called `rawAdcValue`.
      - Scale the integer value contained in `rawAdcValue` to a
        floating-point number of type `filter_data_t` that is between
        -1.0 and 1.0. Store this value into a variable named
        `scaledAdcValue`. The ADC generates a 12-bit output that ranges
        from 0 to 4095. 0 would map to -1.0. 4095 maps to 1.0. Values in
        between 0 and 4095 map linearly to values between -1.0 and 1.0.
        **Note: this is a common source of bugs. Carefully test the code
        that does this mapping.**
      - Invoke `filter_addSample(scaledAdcValue)`. This provides a new
        input to the filter stages.
      - If `filter_addSample()` returns true, meaning that decimation
        occurred and the filter stages were run, then do the following:
          - Get a copy of the energy values with a call to
            `filter_getEnergyArray()`.
          - Pass these energy values to the function `detector_checkHit()`
            to check for a hit. There is no need to take action here if
            there is a hit since a user can retrieve the hit status later
            with `detector_getHit()`.

Assumptions:

1.  _Reading from the ADC receive buffer is protected with a critical
    section._ The provided implementation of the receiver driver complies
    with this assumption and protects all accesses to the buffer with
    critical sections.
1.  _Draining the ADC receive buffer occurs faster than it can fill._ When
    running the provided test code, the detector run time will be checked
    for compliance. The detector run time will be printed as `det:NN ms`.

### Shot Counter

The shot module manages the shot count and can be used to support laser
tag with a clip that contains N shots. Once a player has fired N shots
they must wait S seconds for the clip to auto reload. The player may
force a reload of the clip at any time by pulling and holding the
trigger for S seconds (if the clip contains shots, the initial press of
the trigger will fire a shot).

#### Specification

  - During initialization, the shot count is set to the maximum count N.
    Also, a reload timer is created.
  - The shot count is decremented with `shot_decrement()` (when a user
    fires a shot) and can be reloaded after a delay (S).
  - A call to `shot_timer_start()` initiates a timer that runs once for
    the period specified in `shot_init()`.
  - At timer expiration, the shot count is reloaded to the maximum count
    and the "reload" callback function is called.
  - The timer can be stopped before expiration with a call to
    `shot_timer_stop()`, thus preventing a reload of shots.

#### Detail

Use a [FreeRTOS software timer](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/system/freertos_idf.html#timer-api)
to implement the reload timer. Configure the timer to be a one-shot
timer with the period specified as a parameter in `shot_init()`.

The shot component uses a callback function to notify a user when a
reload occurs. The function to be called must be "registered" by the
user with the shot component and saved for later use. This is done by
passing a function pointer to a user function (outside of shot.c) as an
argument to `shot_register_reload()`. This shot register function should
only be called by an external user of the shot component and not from
within. You will need to create a global variable to save the function
pointer argument. If a callback function has not been registered, then
no function should be called for that event. See this reference on
[pointers to functions](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Pointers_and_arrays#Pointers_to_Functions)
if needed.

The `expire_actions()` timer callback function described above should
call the shot callback function to notify the user of the reload event
and set the shot counter back to the maximum count.

## Other Help

### FreeRTOS Software Timer

<!-- ??Move following paragraph (and sketch) to a separate page?? -->
When using a FreeRTOS software timer, make sure to include the FreeRTOS
header and the timers header at the beginning of your file. Also, make
sure that you save a handle to the created timer globally so you can
access it in other functions within the file. The callback function
passed as an argument to `xTimerCreate()` must match the expected type.
In the sketch below, the `expire_actions()` callback function is an
example of this type.

```c
#include "freertos/FreeRTOS.h"
#include "freertos/timers.h"

static TimerHandle_t timer; // Declare timer handle

// Callback function called when the timer expires
static void expire_actions(TimerHandle_t pt)
{
}
```
