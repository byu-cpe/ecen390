## Overview

One of the essential parts of the laser tag signal processing system is
the second stage, which consists of a bank of bandpass filters. In this
task, you are going to design a bank of 10 bandpass filters and test
them with simulated signals at the different player frequencies.

### General Requirements

  - Review IIR filter design
  - Design 10 IIR bandpass filters centered at the player frequencies
  - Analyze the performance of the 10 IIR bandpass filters and
    make sure that they meet the specifications

### General Notes

For this stage of the signal processing system, assume your signal is
already downsampled to 10 ksamples/s. Remember that the previous stage
processed the signal at a higher sample rate before downsampling. Please
pay particular attention to the specifications for the bandpass filters.
Meeting these specifications is necessary for a functional laser tag
unit and for uniformity between them when you actually use your laser
tag unit for game play.

### Specifications

The 10 bandpass filters should be IIR filters with the following
specifications.

  - Filter type: Butterworth bandpass filters centered at the player
    frequencies
  - Player frequencies: 1250, 1481, 1739, 2000, 2353, 2667, 3077, 3333,
    3636, 4000 (all in Hz)
  - Filter order: 6 (or more in steps of 2)
  - Filter form: Use second-order sections (SOS) for
    stability in single precision
  - Bandwidth: 50 Hz or less between low and high cutoff frequency.
    - Equal filter bandwidths for all 10 filters
  - Attenuation:
    -  3 dB (half-power) or more at +- 25 Hz around center frequency
    - 40 dB or more for adjacent player frequency (at the center)
  - Sampling frequency: 10 kHz
  - Pulse length: 200 ms
    - NOTE: A pulse length of 200 ms sampled at a frequency of
      10 ksamples/s will yield a signal with 2000 total samples

## Motivation

As you know, the laser tag system supports 10 players each with an
assigned frequency in the range of 1.2 - 4.0 kHz. If the receiver is
being illuminated or 'hit' by a laser tag beam then the sampled signal
will consist of both a square wave at a particular frequency and noise.
The system needs to analyze the received signal to determine whether the
sampled signal contains a 'hit' by a laser tag unit. As the shooting unit
gets farther away from the receiver, the amplitude of the square wave
signal from the shooting unit gets smaller. Since the noise amplitude
stays the same, this corresponds to a lower SNR, and it gets harder to
distinguish the signal from the noise. This figure shows a square wave
added to a random noise signal:

![]({{media}}square_example.jpg)

It will be easy for you to see the square wave in the close range
signal, when the SNR is high. However, for longer-range signals, it will
just look like noise even though there is a square wave embedded in the
signal. The beauty of your signal processing system will be in its
ability to detect a hit in the noisy received signal even at relatively
large ranges.

The 'hit' signal has a frequency spectrum concentrated at the modulating
frequency, while the noise is spread out over a wider frequency band. A
simple method to extract the signal from the noise would be to compute a
Fourier transform of the received signal, and then see if there is a
spike in frequency at one of the player frequencies.

Unfortunately, computing a Fourier transform of the incoming signal
requires too much computation time to enable it to be performed in
real-time by our laser tag system. Therefore, we are effectively going
to make a 'coarse' Fourier transform using our bank of 10 bandpass
filters, and see if there is a spike in the signal energy coming out of
any of the filters. This is computationally much more efficient, and can
be implemented in real time (provided we keep the order of our filter
low enough).

We are going to be using an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) digital
filter. The properties of an [IIR filter](
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response) are described on
Wikipedia. An IIR digital filter is characterized by two sets of
coefficients called 'a' and 'b'. You may also want to review the sections
on IIR filters in the [ECEN 380 Discrete-Time Filters Lab]({% link
media/docs/filter/lab5.pdf %}).

There are lots of different filter designs that have already been
developed. A few of the common types of filters are Butterworth,
Chebyshev, and Elliptic. MATLAB has functions that produce the
coefficients (a and b) for these filters. Let's use the Butterworth
filter for this example. A description of the
[Butterworth filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter) is
available on Wikipedia. At the bottom of the Wikipedia page there is a
comparison to the other common types of digital filters.

Use the MATLAB butter function to create the filter coefficients. When
learning how to use a new function in MATLAB, you can get help by typing
the command name in the search box (upper right in the window) or you
can type `help` followed by the function name on the MATLAB command
line. More detail about the
[MATLAB butter]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/matlab/#butter) function can also
be found on this website.

{: .important }
The first argument to the The [MATLAB butter](
https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/butter.html) function
represents one-half the filter order for bandpass designs. The next
argument takes frequencies in units of half-cycles/sample. You can think
of this as a normalized frequency in the range of 0 to 1, where one
corresponds to half your sampling frequency. It simply tells you how
many half-cycles your signal goes through per sample. The easiest way to
get these normalized frequencies in half-cycles/sample is to divide your
frequency in Hz by half the sample rate. I suggest keeping all of your
frequencies in your MATLAB code as human readable Hz, and then simply
divide your frequencies in Hz by half your sample rate when you pass
them to the butter function.

### Filter Creation

Since the laser tag system computes with single precision arithmetic,
our IIR filter designs will need better numerical stability by using
cascaded second-order sections (SOS). Another term for a second-order
section is a [biquad filter](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter). Unfortunately,
the butter function cannot directly output coefficients in SOS form. An
extra step is needed. First, capture the filter coefficients in
zero-pole-gain form. Then, convert them to SOS form using the [MATLAB
zp2sos]( https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/zp2sos.html)
function. Embed the gain in the first section. In addition, convert from
double precision to single precision so that your analysis and simulation
is more representative of the processing that will happen in the laser
tag embedded system. You want to catch any numerical instabilities now
in MATLAB and not when you are trying to program your laser tag system
in 'C'. A MATLAB cell array works well for storing the SOS matrix of
coefficients for each of the 10 IIR filters. A sketch of the filter
creation is shown below:

```m
IIR_sos = cell(1, length(f_players)); % create cell array
% loop over each player frequency
    [zbp,pbp,kbp] = butter(...); % Butterworth filter
    IIR_sos{i} = single(zp2sos(zbp,pbp,kbp)); % convert to SOS
% end loop
```

The filter design parameters (what you can change) are:
1. the filter type (i.e., Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.),
2. the filter order, and
3. the cutoff frequencies.

To make it easier for the TAs to help, we are going to limit the number
of design parameters. We want **all to use the Butterworth filter design**.
Furthermore, we are going to **limit the filter order to 6** so that
your filters can operate in real time on the laser tag system. Note that
this corresponds to 3 second-order sections (SOS) cascaded together. If
the filter order is too high, it may not run fast enough on the laser tag
system.

The only design parameter left to vary is the cutoff frequencies (based
on the bandwidth) of the filters. Each Butterworth bandpass filter has
two frequency corners. It should pass signals with frequency components
between these two corners and attenuate other components. Next, create
the bandpass Butterworth filter, and generate the second-order sections
for the filter.

{: .note }
If we were performing true coarse frequency domain analysis, the filter
would need to cover the entire band between the different player
frequencies. However, in this system, we have a discrete set of
allowable frequencies. The filter just needs to pass one of these
allowable frequencies to see if the receiver is 'hit'. Therefore, the
bandwidth of the filter just needs to cover the specific allowable
frequency that it is assigned. This means that for narrower bandwidths,
more noise will be rejected and better system performance can be
expected. However, this assumes that the frequency of the transmitter
does not change at all. Therefore, we need to create some bandwidth to
allow wobble in the player frequency. How much bandwidth is actually
needed? After your laser tag units are built, experiments can determine
the best bandwidth for your system. In this example, we start with a
bandwidth of 50 Hz.

### Save Coefficients

Make sure to save your IIR filter coefficients for a later lab as a
.mat file. Also, save them in a human readable format (.csv file) for
your report and pass-off. The following code assumes your SOS filter
coefficients are stored in a MATLAB cell array named IIR_sos.

```m
% Save IIR filter coefficients
save('IIR_sos.mat',"IIR_sos"); % save to binary .mat file
% loop over each player frequency
    if (i == 1) % write to human readable .csv file
        writematrix(IIR_sos{i},'IIR_sos.csv','WriteMode','overwrite');
    else
        writematrix(IIR_sos{i},'IIR_sos.csv','WriteMode','append');
    end
% end loop
```

In a future milestone, you will need to convert your MATLAB filter
coefficients into 'C' code for the laser tag system. A script will be
provided to ease this conversion. The script expects the following
naming convention and format for the IIR filter coefficients when saved
to a .mat file:

  - _IIR\_sos_ is an _F_ element cell array of _S x 6_ single-precision
    matrices
  - _F_ is the number of IIR filters (10), one for each player frequency
  - _S_ is the number of second-order sections in a filter (3)
  - Each section contains 6 coefficients _{b0, b1, b2, 1, a1, a2}_

## Bandpass Filter Analysis

To determine whether the Butterworth filters are designed properly, we
need to analyze the filters. The filter analysis will include both a
frequency domain and time domain analysis.

### Frequency Domain Bandpass Filter Analysis

In the frequency domain, each bandpass filter should have a flat
transfer function around the frequency that the filter is supposed to
pass, and then decrease as the frequency gets farther away from the
frequency corners. You can plot the frequency domain transfer function
using the [MATLAB freqz]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/matlab/#freqz) function.

I suggest using the following form of freqz:

```m
% sos   : matrix of filter coefficients in SOS form (e.g. 3x6 matrix)
% f_axis: vector of frequencies in Hz to evaluate (e.g. 0 to 5 kHz)
% f_s   : sampling frequency in Hz (e.g. 10,000)
H = freqz(sos, f_axis, f_s);
```

Plot the output of freqz against your frequency axis _f\_axis_. You
should create a frequency domain plot for each of the bandpass filters
and overlay them on the same plot. The result should look similar to the
following.

![]({{media}}m_2_1_1.jpg)

The horizontal axis should be the frequency in Hz and cover the entire
allowable frequency band (0\<f\<5kHz). The vertical axis should be the
magnitude of the frequency response.

### Time Domain Bandpass Filter Analysis

The bandpass filters will eventually be implemented in 'C' code for
execution on the laser tag system in the time domain. This reduces the
computational cost of determining a hit to a level realizable on an
embedded system. MATLAB will not be available on the laser tag system.
However, we can model and simulate the signal processing system in
MATLAB to make sure it will function as needed in the laser tag embedded
system.

For this milestone, we need to analyze the output of each filter
in the time domain and determine whether a hit was registered.
The basic steps are the following:

1.  Create a square wave signal
    1.  Use one of the player frequencies
    2.  Sampling frequency Fs = 10 ksamples/s
    3.  Pulse length of 200ms (2000 samples)
2.  Filter the square wave signal
    1.  Pass the signal through each of the 10 bandpass filters
3.  Compute the total energy in each filtered signal
    1.  Square and then sum each sample in the signal
4.  Plot the 10 energies
    1.  Visualize if a 'hit' came through on a matching frequency
5.  Repeat the process for the next player frequency

Let's walk through this process for the first player.

**Step 1**: Create a square wave signal

Use the MATLAB square function to create the signal. The square function
is similar to the sin function except that it produces a square wave
rather than a sine wave. Here is the MATLAB code to create the square
wave:

```m
Fs = 10e3;                   % The sampling frequency
t = linspace(0, 0.2, 2000);  % The time vector with a length of 0.2 seconds and 2000 total samples
freq = 1250;                 % The frequency of player 1
x = square(2*pi*freq*t);     % Create the time domain square wave
```

**Step 2**: Filter the square wave signal

Since our IIR filter coefficients are in SOS form, use the [MATLAB
sosfilt](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/sosfilt.html) function
to perform the actual filtering in this milestone. We need to filter
the square wave signal (called 'x' in Step 1) using each of our 10
bandpass filters.

Plot the output of the filter function (operating on your square wave
signal) for each of the 10 bandpass filters. The following plot shows
the output of the first 4 bandpass filters when the square wave input
has a frequency of 1250 Hz (player 1):

![]({{media}}filtered2.jpg)

You can see from this plot that filters 2, 3, and 4 attenuate the signal
a lot compared to filter 1 (look at the amplitudes of each filtered
signal). The output of filter 1 has a much higher amplitude. If you zoom
in on the output of filter 1 you should be able to see that the square
wave was changed into a sine wave by the filter. (Do you understand why
this happens? Remember that the square wave signal contains a sinusoid
at the fundamental frequency, as well as higher frequency harmonics that
give it a square shape. Our bandpass filter effectively takes out the
higher harmonic frequencies that make it a square wave, leaving only the
sinusoid at the fundamental frequency\!)

**Step 3**: Compute the energy in each filtered signal

Looking at the outputs of the 10 filters, it is evident that when the
square wave has a frequency that matches the frequency of a filter, the
amplitude of the filtered signal will be much higher. You need a way of
robustly determining which filtered signal has the highest average
amplitude. However, if you simply take the largest value in each
filtered signal, the system will be very susceptible to noise. A better
way is to determine the total energy in each signal.

The total energy in a signal is found by squaring each sample over a
window of time and then summing all of the squared samples. In our
implementation, we are looking at a 200ms window of samples because that
is the duration of our shots. These 200ms windows of output from each
filter are sampled at 10 ksamples/s, yielding 2000 total samples. Thus,
the summation for our signal energy calculation is only going to be over
2000 samples.

After we have computed the energy of each filtered signal, we can
collect the results in an array.

**Step 4**: Plot the 10 energies

Next, plot a bar graph using the MATLAB bar function showing each of the
energy array values. Your resulting bar graph, based on the player 1
signal, should look like this:

![]({{media}}energy.jpg)

You should produce 10 of these plots, one for each of the 10 player
frequencies. I suggest using the MATLAB tiledlayout function to tile
small versions of each plot in a single figure. Visualize if a 'hit'
came through on matching frequencies.
