## Overview

For this milestone, you will implement a complete game with sound and
**hopefully have fun with your laser tag system**. The game is to support
play between two teams of any number of players. Unlike your other
programming assignments, you are free to implement the game as you like,
as long as you meet the requirements for game functionality, including
sound. The coding standard still applies.

## Resources

### Source Code

Note that the following files are provided in your ecen390 project
directory. Refer to the comments above each function for more detail.

  - ltag/main/main.c
  - ltag/main/game.h

You are expected to create and implement the following file. See the
provided header file (.h) for more detail.

### Making Sound

You are provided working sound code and sound data.<!--  in the sound
subdirectory. --> While coding this milestone, you need to add calls to
these sound functions so that various sounds are made during game play.

<!-- Please read the comments and the sound\_runTest() function in sound.c to
see how to use the sound code (it is straightforward).

{: .note }
Make sure to add `sound_tick()` to isr\_function() along with all
of the other `_tick()` functions.

{: .warning }
WHEN SET TO ITS MAXIMUM VALUE, THE SOUND VOLUME MAY DAMAGE
YOUR HEARING IF YOU PLUG EARPHONES INTO THE ZYBO BOARD. Volume can be
controlled by using the function 'sound\_setVolume()', found in the
sound.c file. Please read sound.c for more detail on how to use this
function. -->

<!-- #### Videos

These videos demonstrate when sounds should be played and also show more
detailed behavior of the game.

    etc.](https://youtu.be/klppe7oTng4)

## Game Specifications

The game functions as follows. The game is essentially a version of
"last person standing". The game ends when all of the members of either
Team-A or Team-B have "died". The winning team is the team that has at
least one member remaining "alive" at the end of the game.

### "Last Person Standing"

1.  Only 2 frequencies are used. Team-A will use frequency 6 for
    shooting and will detect hits only on frequency 8. Team-B will shoot
    on frequency 8 and detect hits only on frequency 6.
2.  Teams can consist of any number of persons; teams should start with
    the same number of members for fairness.
3.  Each team member has their own laser tag unit.
4.  Team membership is determined by navigating a menu with the buttons.
5.  Each member starts the game with 3 lives. Once all lives are
    expended, shooting is disabled and the person leaves the game.
6.  The game ends when all members of either team have lost all lives.
7.  No communication between laser tag units is required. Each tag unit
    functions independently and players drop out of the game as they
    lose lives. You can tell that the game is over when all members of
    one team have dropped out of the game and returned to base.

### Configuration Numbers

Note that the numbers below have been refined over several playing
sessions. The current configuration seems to provide a nice balance of
fun game play and low complexity.

1.  Each team member starts with 3 lives.
2.  A team member loses a life when they accumulate 5 hits.
3.  The tag unit has a "clip" that contains 10 shots. Once a player has
    fired 10 shots they must wait 3 seconds for the clip to "auto-load".
4.  The player may force a reload of the clip at any time by pulling and
    holding the trigger for 3 seconds (if the clip contains shots, the
    initial push of the trigger will fire a shot).
5.  Immediately after losing a life, a player is invincible for 5
    seconds thus giving them time to quickly scurry away. Note that you
    are not allowed to shoot while invincible.

### Sounds

Sound is essential to game play. It informs the player when they have
been hit, when they have lost a life, and when they have expended all
lives and must drop out of the game. In detail:

1.  A laser-like sound is played each time a player fires a shot. If the
    clip is empty, a "click" sound is played when the trigger is pushed.
2.  A "scream and die" sound is played when the player has lost a life.
3.  A Gameboy startup sound will play when the laser tag unit is first
    turned on.
4.  A "reload" sound is played each time the clip is loaded (either
    automatically or manually).
5.  An "ouch" sound is played each time a player is hit.
6.  A Pacman "game over" sound is played once a player has lost all
    lives.
7.  A voice will inform a player when they must drop from the game and
    "return to base." This voice sound will be infinitely repeated,
    alternated with 1 second of silence.

## Implementation Details

### Game Code Sketch

A sketch is given below as a starting point for an implementation of
game.c. You will need to finish the implementation.

<!-- Feel free to copy code in `runningModes.c` to jump start your
implementation of game-play mode. However, you will be responsible for
making sure any "copied" code still meets the coding standard. -->

<!-- TODO: update this code -->
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// This game supports two teams, Team-A and Team-B.
// Each team operates on its own configurable frequency.
// Each player has a fixed set of lives and once they
// have expended all lives, operation ceases and they are told
// to return to base to await the ultimate end of the game.
// The tag unit is clip-based and each clip contains a fixed number
// of shots that takes a short time to reload a new clip.
// The clips are automatically loaded.
void game_twoTeamTag(void) {
  uint16_t hitCount = 0;

  // Configuration...

  // Implement game loop...

  // End game loop...
}
```

## Pass Off and Grading

Grades for Milestone 5 will be determined by the functionality of the
game and the lack of observable bugs. Teams will get credit for each
feature that is correctly implemented.

1.  Game startup sound (5%): correctly generating the game startup
    sound.
2.  Tag unit firing (20%): correctly implementing firing sound, e.g.,
    the tag unit fires a shot when the trigger is pulled and makes a
    clicking noise when 10 shots have been fired and the unit has not
    been reloaded (automatically or manually).
3.  Auto and manual reload (20%): correctly implementing the auto and
    manual load feature; the tag unit auto-loads once the clip is empty
    and the user can force a manual reload by holding the trigger for
    the appropriate amount of time.
4.  Lives (20%): correctly keeping track of lives and properly
    generating the death sound when 5 shots have been accumulated.
5.  End of Game (10%): correctly generate the end-of-life game sound,
    and play the "return to base" sound as required.
6.  Bugs (25%): No detectable bugs. Subtract 5% for each detected bug up
    to the total for this category. Bugs can include:
    - False hits at any point.
    - Incorrectly keeping track of lives.
    - Undue static.
    - Incorrect game play.

One of the best ways to find bugs in your system is to play it
extensively. If the TA detects a bug during pass off, the team can
attempt to fix their system and pass off later. However, don't depend
upon the TA to detect bugs in your system. You must test and fully debug
your system prior to bringing it to the TAs for pass off. If pass-off
attempts become excessive, we will institute a penalty of some sort.
