## Overview

Now that you have completely implemented the 2-team game, do something
fun and interesting with your system. Here is how it works.

1.  Submit a short proposal (2-3 sentences is plenty) via Learning
    Suite. The proposal will be reviewed to make sure it is not too
    difficult or too easy. Once approved, a score for this assignment
    will be entered into Learning Suite for each member of your team.
2.  Submit via Learning Suite (M6 Report) your approved proposal text
    (2-3 sentences) and a link to a short video (2-3 minutes)
    demonstrating your proposed features.

Please use the Submission Notes to paste your proposal text and video
link when submitting an assignment in Learning Suite. **Do not submit a
separate document (.pdf, .docx, .txt).** Make sure your video link is
publicly viewable.

{: .note }
**Your team is on the hook to achieve what you proposed, so start
early\!** I can't help you with bugs/problems if you leave this until the
end of the semester. If you can't get your project to work at all, it
will be very difficult to offer much in the way of partial credit.

## Video Grading

In most cases, a well-edited video of no more than 2-3 minutes should be
adequate.

Here is the grading rubric for your video:

1.  Overall quality of the video. Please edit your video and make it a
    quality presentation: 25%.
2.  Demonstration of proposed features, i.e., do you demonstrate the
    functionality of everything that you proposed to do?: 50%.
3.  Creativity and novelty of your video presentation, i.e., is your
    video interesting and engaging?: 15%.
4.  Entertainment value, i.e., is your video fun to watch?: 10%.

## Appendix

In this appendix you can find additional information that can be used
for creative projects.

### Custom Sounds

If you have a custom sound in the form of a WAV file that you want to
use in your project, it will need to be converted to an array of values
in a C file. <!-- Look in the lasertag/sound directory for existing examples. -->

  - One option is to use
    [WAVToCode](https://colinjs.com/software.htm#t_WAVToCode) to convert
    your WAV file to C code. It is a Windows application, so you will
    need to find a Windows machine to run it.
  - Another option is to compile the wav2c.c source code (in the sound
    directory) and run it from the command line. This program expects a
    single-channel (monophonic) PCM format WAV file as input and will
    produce C code as output. If your WAV file is stereo, you will need
    to convert it to monophonic before using wav2c. You can use
    [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to edit and prepare your
    WAV files before converting them to C code.

<!-- You are free to modify sound.c (in the sound directory) to integrate
your custom sound.

### Bluetooth Modem

The Bluetooth modem is connected to the ZYNQ FPGA via a fixed-rate 9600
BAUD modem. Communication with the modem is simple enough: characters
pushed out the Bluetooth UART are transmitted via the Bluetooth modem
and vice versa for receive. I have included documentation for the UART
below. There is a bluetooth directory in the lasertag directory that
contains source code that shows how to communicate with the bluetooth
modem. The provided example program (main.c) is simple. It receives
characters from the bluetooth modem, converts them to upper case and
then echos the converted characters to the phone. You use the provided
Adafruit Bluefruit Connect App, which is available for both IOS and
Android. Links to the documentation are provided below. There is
additional information in the README.txt file contained in the bluetooth
subdirectory contained in the lasertag directory. You can build and test
the provided code by uncommenting one line in the lasertag
CMakeLists.txt file.

### Accessing Additional Pins

Not all of the pins on the ZYBO board are in use. Several digital pins
are available for your use in your creative projects. See the pictures
below for their location. To use these pins, you will need to use the
GPIO driver.
