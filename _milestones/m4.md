## Overview

In this milestone, you will integrate and test all the software you
have written on your laser tag unit hardware. No new code is required.
If you have any issues with your analog board or laser tag system as a
whole, you will need to resolve them now so you can demonstrate your
system for pass-off. You will also adjust the hit sensitivity of your
laser tag unit and characterize each unit. Adjusting the sensitivity
can account for variations in the design and performance of each analog
board. This milestone will be accomplished as a team. However, each
member of the team needs to fully contribute to the work. You will
demonstrate the functionality of your laser tag units and write a
statistical report as described further below.

Each group (typically 2 students) will:
  - Discover and record the minimum and maximum threshold factor
    (hit sensitivity) for your tag unit
    - Detect only actual shots -- no false detects
    - Each tag unit may have a different factor depending on the analog board
  - Verify functionality using a pair of laser tag units
    - Shoot when the trigger is pulled
    - Change the transmit channel
    - Record valid hits on each of the 10 channels
    - Flash the 'hit indicator' red when hit
    - Lock out the detection of hits when the 'hit indicator' is on

The team (typically 4 students) will:
  - Perform a set of statistical distance experiments
  - Compare the performance of each pair of units
  - Demonstrate functionality for pass-off
  - Write a statistical report

## M4 Test Program

You will use the M4 test program to perform the tests and experiments
needed for this milestone. It uses all of your code developed in class.
Therefore, it is useful in making sure all the modules you wrote work
well together and perform the necessary tag related functions, such as,
making shots and detecting hits at a practical range.

Since this test is intended to operate on battery power without a cable
connection to a host computer, it does not print results to the
terminal output. All interaction occurs through the display, buttons,
and trigger. The display shows several control and status items.

  - Control panel:
    - Transmit mode (TX):
      - on: continuous, useful in focusing the optics
      - shot: 200 ms pulse when trigger is pressed
    - Channel (CH): transmit channel, 0-9
    - Threshold factor (THRESH): hit sensitivity of the detector in
      powers of 2
  - Status panel:
    - Hits (HITS): total hits detected (counts up from 0)
    - Shots (SHOTS): shots remaining (counts down from 40)
  - Histogram: displays the hits received on each channel

The four navigator (NAV) buttons on the laser tag unit interact with the
control panel.

  - NAV Left: Move control selection left
  - NAV Right: Move control selection right
  - NAV Up: Increment the selected control option
  - NAV Down: Decrement the selected control option

Pressing the trigger will fire a shot. Holding the trigger for 3 seconds
will reload the shot count to 40 and reset the hit count to 0. These
counts are useful when performing the statistical distance experiments.

When a hit occurs, the NeoPixel LEDs will flash red for 500 ms. If they
flash a different color, you will need to fix the pixel color order in
hitLedTimer.c.

Before building the M4 test code, first set the MILESTONE variable in
ltag/main/CMakeLists.txt to "m4". Load the M4 test program into flash
memory with the `idf.py flash` command.

{: .note }
The Milestone 4 test program ignores hits on the currently selected
transmit channel. Otherwise, the transmit signal feeds back optically
and electrically into the receiver causing a hit on your own unit.

## Integration and Test

Make sure that your group has two laser tag units with charged batteries
and functional analog boards. If you are confident that your laser tag
unit hardware is working well from Milestone 1, you can skip to Step 2.

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic Program

The diagnostic program does not use your code developed in class, but
uses reference code instead. Therefore, it is more useful for detecting
hardware issues with your laser tag unit.

1.  Load the diagnostic program into flash memory using [these
    instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/milestones/m1/#verify-functionality).
1.  Set each laser tag unit to a different transmit channel, one to
    channel 6 and the other to channel 8.
1.  Point the tag units at each other and hold the trigger to emit a
    signal on the selected channel.
1.  View the histogram on the LCD display to see if you are detecting
    energy on the correct channel.
1.  Increase and decrease distance between the tag units and watch to
    see how this affects the histogram display.

{: .note }
It is normal to see some amount of noise, e.g., small amounts of energy
on all the channels. However, the energy for the shooter's transmit
signal should be higher than the background noise.

If you don't see energy showing up on the shooter's transmit channel,
don't bother trying to run the M4 test. Get the diagnostic test working
first. At this point, because you passed off M3T3, you can have more
confidence that all of your software works correctly, so the problem is
likely one of the following hardware issues:

  - The transmitter is not properly generating a square wave signal or
    a light beam at the desired frequency.
  - The receiver is not detecting a light signal through the photo
    diode.
  - A bad analog cable connection. Check that your cables are connected
    in the proper orientation.

Make sure that your analog board is working correctly. If needed, you
can go back and redo the analog board tests using the test setup in the
rear of the lab.

### Step 2: Sensitivity Test

In this step, you will discover and record the minimum and maximum
threshold factor (hit sensitivity) for your tag unit using the M4 test
program. Each unit may have different values. Make sure the M4 test
program is loaded into flash memory before running the tests.

The hit sensitivity can be adjusted by changing the threshold factor.
Just remember that a lower threshold factor will allow hits to be
detected more easily, but it will also increase the chance of false hits
caused by noise. On the other hand, a higher threshold factor will make
the receiving tag unit more immune to false hits caused by noise, but
it will lower your overall sensitivity and the potential distance from a
shooter that a hit can be detected.

The general idea behind hit detection is that the threshold for a hit
*tracks* the current background noise to some degree. Thus if the
frequency channels all have energy values that are a little high, the
computed threshold also tracks higher. Vice versa, if the frequency
channels all have energy values that are lower, the computed threshold
also tracks lower. In practice this strategy works quite well,
achieving distances of 100 feet or more.

{: .warning }
Some computer displays and laptop screens can radiate light noise at
frequencies that correspond with the laser tag unit channels. If you
notice stray hits coming in at higher threshold levels, move away from
a computer display to make sure it is not the source of the noise.

#### Minimum Threshold Factor

Even though the transmit channel is ignored, there is enough energy
feeding back on other channels to cause a hit at low threshold factors
(high sensitivity). **The goal of this test is to find the lowest
threshold factor that does not detect a self hit when a shot is fired.**
This setting will give you the longest range on your tag unit, but may
occasionally give you false hits. If you set the threshold factor even
lower, you will reach a point that background noise will continually
cause hits.

1.  Power-on or reset the unit. The default channel should be 6.
1.  Highlight the threshold factor control (THRESH) using the NAV Left
    and Right buttons.
1.  Press the trigger to fire a shot.
1.  If a self hit _was not_ shown on the display, repeat decreasing
    the threshold factor (NAV Down) until firing a shot causes a self hit.
1.  If a self hit _was_ shown on the display, repeat increasing
    the threshold factor (NAV Up) until firing a shot does not cause a
    self hit.
1.  Record the lowest threshold factor that does not detect a self hit
    when a shot is fired.

#### Maximum Threshold Factor

Higher threshold factors reduce the sensitivity of the detector. **The
goal of this test is to find the highest threshold factor for your unit
that can still detect a hit at 40 feet.** This is the most noise immune
setting for your unit that is still useful for game play. For this test
you will need two tag units from your group, one to transmit and the
other to receive. The transmitting unit will need to be located
**40 feet away** from the receiver.

1.  Power-on or reset both units. The default channel should be 6.
1.  Set the transmitting unit to channel 8.
1.  Focus the light beam of the transmitting unit.
1.  Highlight the threshold factor control (THRESH) using the NAV Left
    and Right buttons.
1.  Turn the receiving unit 90 degrees to one side so that the acrylic
    side panel is facing the transmitting unit.
1.  Fire a shot from the transmitting unit at the receiver. Try another
    shot if your aim is off.
1.  Check that the hit occurs on channel 8.
1.  If a hit _was_ shown on the display, repeat increasing
    the threshold factor (NAV Up) until firing a shot does not cause a
    hit.
1.  If a hit _was not_ shown on the display, repeat decreasing
    the threshold factor (NAV Down) until firing a shot causes a hit.
1.  Record the highest threshold factor that detects a hit
    when a shot is fired.

Repeat the test with the other tag unit now as the receiver.

{: .note }
The receiving lens on the front of your tag unit is more sensitive to a
shot coming straight from the front. The sensitivity is less for a shot
coming from the side. By turning the unit 90 degrees to the side in the
threshold test, it ensures that the determined threshold factor can
detect side shots.

If your tag unit is not behaving as expected, go back to Step 1 and
run the diagnostic program.

## Statistical Distance Experiments

As a team, you will perform a set of statistical distance experiments as
described below. Also, as a team you will write a statistical report
that describes the results and conclusions from your experiments.

Create shooter data by making shooting attempts at 20', 40', and 60'
using each group's laser tag units in your team. Typically, this would
involve using Group X's pair of tag units to collect one set of data,
and using Group Y's units for another set of data. Compute the statistics
as discussed below for each group's laser tag units. Compare the
statistics for each group. Is one group's laser tag units clearly better
than another under all situations?

### Overview

By now, you have seen that many engineering problems can be modeled with
random variables. For example, you learned in ECEN 240 that Ohm's law
dictates the exact voltage drop _V_ across a resistor as a function of the
current across the resistor _I_ and the resistor's resistance value _R_.
That relationship is now familiar to you, and can be expressed as:

![vir.png]({{media}}vir.png)

Yet, if you were to measure the resistance, the current, and the
voltage, you probably wouldn't be surprised to see a small deviation in
the resulting relationship between the three measurements. In other
words, you might actually observe:

![vire.png]({{media}}vire.png)

for some small, but nonzero, value of epsilon.

Often these small differences occur from the inaccuracy of our
measurements, and often they occur due to small differences in the
environments or small defects in the materials. The combination of
several of these small effects can easily be modeled by letting epsilon
be a random variable with a certain distribution defined over its range
of values. The Gaussian distribution tends to model several natural
phenomena, resulting in its importance in statistical analysis. In many
engineering applications, we want actual measurements to inform our
understanding of the distribution of epsilon. Is it really Gaussian?
What are the mean and variance of the distribution? Statistics can help
us answer these questions.

Now, let's apply this principle to your overall laser tag system.
Although you have verified that your system "works" at 40 feet, we might
naturally ask a follow on question: "How well does it work?" To answer
this question, the principles of STAT 201 can help us form a meaningful
statistical analysis. In other words, we will let _W_ be a random variable
with its distribution defined as:

![probability.png]({{media}}probability.png)

where _W_ = 1 indicates that your receiving laser tag unit detects a 'hit,'
and _W_ = 0 indicates that it misses a detection. (This type of random
variable is known as a Bernoulli random variable, and you probably
recognize it as one of the simplest ways to model outcomes of a random
experiment.) A hit may miss detection for a number of reasons. You
should brainstorm several reasons why these occur while you conduct this
experiment.

### Objective

The purpose of this experiment is to apply probabilistic and statistical
tools from STAT 201 to help you understand the reliability of your laser
tag system (and your aim).

### Procedure

1.  Make sure that the M4 test program is loaded in flash memory.
1.  Reload your shot count and clear the hit count by holding the
    trigger for 3 seconds.
1.  Select one laser tag unit to be your receiver and the
    other unit to be your transmitter.
1.  Focus the light beam of the transmitting unit.
1.  Set the threshold factor of the receiving unit down two increments
    from the maximum determined in the sensitivity test. For example, if
    your maximum threshold factor was 8192, you would set the threshold
    factor to 2048.
1.  Test your system _n_=40 times at each of the three distances: 20 ft,
    40 ft, and 60 ft. Then, use your data to estimate probabilities of
    detection _p_<sub>20</sub>, _p_<sub>40</sub>, and _p_<sub>60</sub>, where
    the subscript indicates the distance between the transmitter and
    receiver for your laser tag system.
    1.  Does it make sense that these probabilities will be different?
        Hypothesize the relationships between these probabilities before
        you begin. That is, which one will be the largest, which one
        will be the smallest, and by about how much will they differ?
        How well do your estimates match your hypotheses?
    1.  As you may recall from STAT 201, the maximum likelihood estimate
        of a probability is simply the ratio of successful trials to the
        number of total experiments.
1.  Calculate the 95% confidence intervals for each of your estimated
    probabilities.
    1.  Remember from STAT 201, if all of you were to run the same
        experiment to estimate a probability _p_, and then calculate
        confidence intervals at the 95% level for your estimate, we
        would expect 95% of you, on average, to actually bound the true
        value of _p_ within your upper and lower bounds of the confidence
        interval. See Section 5.2 (pp. 338-344) of your STAT 201
        textbook for a reference. Given a desired width of your
        confidence interval, and no knowledge of _p_, Example 5.14 may be
        useful in determining the value of _n_ you require. Use a 95%
        confidence interval for your calculations.
    1.  Notice that the width (difference between upper and lower
        bounds) of the confidence interval shrinks as _n_ grows. This
        matches our intuition that more data will result in better
        estimates.
1.  Produce a table summarizing your results. Include the value of _n_,
    the number of successful trials at each distance, your estimates of
    the probabilities _p_<sub>20</sub>, _p_<sub>40</sub>, and
    _p_<sub>60</sub>, and the 95% confidence intervals for each estimate.
1.  Compare the confidence intervals from each group within your team.
    Answer these questions:
    1.  Is one group's units better for all distances?
    1.  Or, is distance the main determining factor, e.g., are one group's
        units better at 20 feet and the other's better at 40 feet?

{: .note }
The assumptions made when using a common formula for confidence intervals are unreliable when the sample size is small or the estimated probability of success (p-hat) is close to zero or one. So in these cases, you may see some intervals slightly less than zero or greater than one. For the purposes of the statistical report, we will accept the error in these assumptions. See [Binomial proportion confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Normal_approximation_interval).
