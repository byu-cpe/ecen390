## Overview

In this milestone, you will adjust the hit sensitivity of your laser tag
unit and characterize each pair of units. <!-- This means that
you must have a couple of working analog boards so you can actually
demonstrate your system. You will be unable to pass off this milestone
unless you can show to the TA that you have these boards in your
possession (as a team). --> This milestone will be accomplished as a
team. However, each member of the team needs to fully contribute to the
work. You will demonstrate the functionality of your laser tag units and
write a statistical report as described further below.

Each group (typically 2 students) working together will:
  - adjust the default hit sensitivity level of their tag units. Each
    unit may have a different level depending on the implementation of
    the analog board.

{%- comment -%}
  - check-out the laser-tag kit from the shop,
  - install the boards that you implemented during ECEN 340,
  - connect the modified Nerf gun,
  - prepare a microSD card to boot the kit with your software, and
{%- endcomment %}

<!-- TODO: this description and partitioning of work may need adjusting. -->
As a team (typically 4 students), you will test each group's laser tag
units and demonstrate the ability to:

  - shoot when the trigger is pulled,
  - record hits using 'shooter mode' with each of the 10 frequencies,
  - change the frequencies<!--  using the switches -->,
  - detect only actual shots (no false detects),
  - flash the 'hit indicator' (NeoPixels) when hit, and
  - lock out the detection of hits when the 'hit indicator' is on.

Finally, as a team you will subject your system to a series of
statistical distance measurements.

<!-- You will need a microSD card for this task. Make sure that it is class
10 or above and has a capacity of at least 8 GB, but not more than 32
GB. The shop should have some of these for sale. If not, the bookstore
or Amazon are good options. -->

{: .note }
It is typically a good idea to implement your software so that each
laser tag unit ignores its own frequency. The light from the shot LED
often leaks through to the photo diode and causes you to be hit by your
own unit.

<!-- ## Testing Details -->

<!-- ### Laser-tag Kit Check Out

Each group (typically 2 students) needs to checkout a laser-tag kit from
the shop (CB 416). The kit contains everything you will need to
implement a full game (except for the electronics that were implemented
during ECEN 340), and includes:

1.  Clear electronic box that contains an interface board for your 340
    circuit boards.
2.  ZYBO board and various already-connected cables.
3.  Shoulder straps with active electronics (sensors and hit-LEDs).
4.  Rechargeable battery.
5.  Modified Nerf gun with cables.

{: .note }
You will not use the ZYBO boards that are provided at your
workstation. You will only use the ZYBO board that comes mounted in the
clear electronics box. A view of the electronics box (opened) is shown
below.

{: .note }
No additional software is required for this milestone. You only
need the software used during Task 3 of Milestone 3.

**VIDEO**: This [video](https://youtu.be/YkBSr4ubWL4) demonstrates how
to assemble the kit with the gun, the receiver board, the transmitter
board, microSD card, battery, etc.

### Install Analog Boards

Each group will need to provide a working analog receiver board and a
transmitter board. Both of these were built during ECEN 340. You will
install these boards into the electronics box - as you did during the
first week of ECEN 390 - and you will connect the modified Nerf gun
cables to the connectors on the top corner of the electronics box.

The connectors for the gun cables are at the top corner of the
electronics box and are circled in the picture shown below.

### SD Card Preparation

Your laser-tag kit needs to be portable; the game wouldn't be much fun
to play if you have to remain attached to a desktop computer via the USB
programming/power cable. As such, the box contains a battery for
powering the kit (you will need to charge this from time to time) and
the ZYBO board has a slot for an microSD card containing the software
that you have, to this point, downloaded to the ZYBO board via the USB
cable. You will copy the software to the SD card using this
[procedure](sd_card). *Note that you can choose to use the software
created by either pair in your team. However, I strongly suggest that
you use the same software for both kits.* Once the SD card is ready to
go, insert it into the SD-card socket on the ZYBO board along with your
receiver and transmitter boards and start testing. Here is a general
outline that you can follow.

## Set Hit Sensitivity

The hit sensitivity can be adjusted by changing the threshold factor.
Try different values until you find one that will just barely detect
(but not miss) "hits" at your testing distance. You will probably tweak
your threshold factor as you do more testing. Just remember that a lower
threshold factor will allow hits to be detected more easily, but it will
also increase the chance of false hits caused by noise. On the other
hand, a higher threshold factor will make the receiving tag unit more
immune to false hits caused by noise, but it will lower your overall
sensitivity and the potential distance from a shooter that a hit can be
detected.

The general idea behind this approach is that the threshold *tracks* the
current background noise to some degree. Thus if the frequency channels
all have energy values that are a little high, the computed threshold
also tracks higher. Vice versa, if the frequency channels all have
energy values that are lower, the computed threshold also tracks lower.
In practice this detection strategy has worked quite well, often
achieving distances of 100' in daylight.

### Approach

Make sure that you have two laser tag units with charged batteries. Here
is how I suggest that you proceed.

### Step 1: Continuous Mode

1.  Set each laser tag unit to a different frequency.
2.  Run both units in continuous mode using the test from Milestone 3
    Task 3 (M3T3).
3.  Point the tag units at each other and view the histogram on the LCD
    display to see if you are detecting energy in the correct frequency.
    Increase and decrease distance between the tag units and watch to
    see how this affects the histogram display. Note that it is normal
    to see some amount of noise, e.g., small amounts of energy for
    frequencies other than that selected on the shooting tag unit.
    However, the energy from the shooter frequency should be higher
    than the background noise.

If this doesn't work, don't bother trying shooter mode. Get continuous
mode working first. At this point, because you passed off M3T3, you know
that all of your software works correctly (that was the point of M3T3),
so the problem is likely one of the following:

  - the transmitter is not properly generating a square wave and light
    beam at the desired frequency. Make sure that your cables are
    connected in the proper orientation. If needed, you can go back and
    redo the tests that you performed in Milestone 1.
  - the receiver is not detecting a light signal through the photo
    diode. Make sure that your analog board is working correctly. Again,
    you can redo the tests you originally performed during Milestone 1
    to debug problems with your analog board.

### Step 2: Shooter Mode

<!-- To enter shooter mode (as long as you are using the original, unmodified
software for main.c with RUNNING\_MODE\_M3\_T3 defined), just hold down
BTN2 while you cycle power on the ZYBO board. The board will come up in
shooter mode. Now,  -->Perform the same tests as before but watch to see
that the histograms on both laser tag units accumulate hits on the
correct frequencies. If you do not detect hits, the problem is likely
the following:

  - Your threshold factor may be too large of a value. Experiment with
    lower values for the threshold factor until you can detect hits at a
    reasonable distance. Try to select a threshold factor that is low
    enough to detect hits at a reasonable distance (40'), but is high
    enough that background noise does not cause false hits.

## Statistical Distance Experiments

As a team, you will perform a set of statistical distance experiments as
described below. Also, as a team you will write a statistical report
that describes the results and conclusions from your experiments.

Create shooter data by making shooting attempts at 20', 40', and 60'
using each group's laser tag units in your team. Typically, this would
involve using Group X's pair of tag units to collect one set of data,
and using Group Y's units for another set of data. Compute the statistics
as discussed below for each group's laser tag units. Compare the
statistics for each group. Is one group's laser tag units clearly better
than another under all situations?

### Overview

By now, you have seen that many engineering problems can be modeled with
random variables. For example, you learned in ECEN 240 that Ohm's law
dictates the exact voltage drop V across a resistor as a function of the
current across the resistor I and the resistor's resistance value R.
That relationship is now familiar to you, and can be expressed as:

![vir.png]({{media}}vir.png)

Yet, if you were to measure the resistance, the current, and the
voltage, you probably wouldn't be surprised to see a small deviation in
the resulting relationship between the three measurements. In other
words, you might actually observe:

![vire.png]({{media}}vire.png)

for some small, but nonzero, value of epsilon.

Often these small differences occur from the inaccuracy of our
measurements, and often they occur due to small differences in the
environments or small defects in the materials. The combination of
several of these small effects can easily be modeled by letting epsilon
be a random variable with a certain distribution defined over its range
of values. The Gaussian distribution tends to model several natural
phenomena, resulting in its importance in statistical analysis. In many
engineering applications, we want actual measurements to inform our
understanding of the distribution of epsilon. Is it really Gaussian?
What are the mean and variance of the distribution? Statistics can help
us answer these questions.

Now, let's apply this principle to your overall laser tag system.
Although you have verified that your system "works" at 40 feet, we might
naturally ask a follow on question: "How well does it work?" To answer
this question, the principles of STAT 201 can help us form a meaningful
statistical analysis. In other words, we will let W be a random variable
with its distribution defined as:

![probability.png]({{media}}probability.png)

where W = 1 indicates that your receiving laser tag unit detects a 'hit,'
and W = 0 indicates that it misses a detection. (This type of random
variable is known as a Bernoulli random variable, and you probably
recognize it as one of the simplest ways to model outcomes of a random
experiment.) Missed detections may occur for a number of reasons. You
should brainstorm several reasons why these occur while you conduct this
experiment.

### Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to apply probabilistic and statistical
tools from STAT 201 to help you understand the reliability of your laser
tag system (and your aim). If you need a review, Kahn academy has some
good explanatory videos on statistics (I used them and found them
helpful for this task).

### Procedure

1.  First, select one laser tag unit to be your receiver and the
    other unit to be your transmitter.
2.  Test your system n=40 times at each of the three distances: 20 ft,
    40 ft, and 60 ft. Then, use your data to estimate probabilities of
    detection p<sub>20</sub>, p<sub>40</sub>, and p<sub>60</sub>, where
    the subscript indicates the distance between the transmitter and
    receiver for your laser tag system.
    1.  Does it make sense that these probabilities will be different?
        Hypothesize the relationships between these probabilities before
        you begin. That is, which one will be the largest, which one
        will be the smallest, and by about how much will they differ?
        How well do your estimates match your hypotheses?
    2.  As you may recall from STAT 201, the maximum likelihood estimate
        of a probability is simply the ratio of successful trials to the
        number of total experiments.
3.  Calculate the 95% confidence intervals for each of your estimated
    probabilities.
    1.  Remember from STAT 201, if all of you were to run the same
        experiment to estimate a probability p, and then calculate
        confidence intervals at the 95% level for your estimate, we
        would expect 95% of you, on average, to actually bound the true
        value of p within your upper and lower bounds of the confidence
        interval. See Section 5.2 (pp. 338-344) of your STAT 201
        textbook for a reference. Given a desired width of your
        confidence interval, and no knowledge of p, Example 5.14 may be
        useful in determining the value of n you require. Use a 95%
        confidence interval for your calculations.
    2.  Notice that the width (difference between upper and lower
        bounds) of the confidence interval shrinks as n grows. This
        matches our intuition that more data will result in better
        estimates.
4.  Produce a table summarizing your results. Include the value of n,
    the number of successful trials at each distance, your estimates of
    the probabilities p<sub>20</sub>, p<sub>40</sub>, and
    p<sub>60</sub>, and the 95% confidence intervals for each estimate.
5.  Compare the confidence intervals from each group within your team.
    1.  Answer these questions: is one system better for all distances?
        Or, does the answer to this question depend upon the distance,
        e.g., is one system better at 20 feet and the other system
        better at 40 feet?

## Pass Off

### Function Demonstration

Each group within your team should demonstrate the following to a TA:

1.  Aim laser tag unit 1 with the shooting LED pointing at the
    photodetector of unit 2
2.  Pull the trigger on unit 1
3.  Show that a hit is recorded on unit 2
4.  Show that the 'Hit Indicator' comes on for unit 2
5.  Verify that unit 2 cannot be hit by an opponent when the 'Hit
    Indicator' is on
6.  Verify that hits can be reliably detected when the laser tag units
    are at least 40 feet apart
7.  Demonstrate that there are no false positives
    1.  Point unit 2 at the room lights and demonstrate that hits are not
        recorded
    2.  Point unit 1 so that it misses the detector of unit 2. Pull the
        trigger and make sure that a hit is not recorded.

Repeat the process with the other unit.

<!-- ### M4 Report

The focus of this report should be on the assembly and function of the
two laser-tag kits. This document should show that you know how the kit
parts function, and at a high level, how the software interacts with the
hardware. You should capture evidence that your kits are working
(oscilloscope plots). Save the details of your statistical experiments
for the Statistical Report (a separate document).

1.  Pictures of the two kits
2.  Description of the physical parts of the kits
3.  Description of the software organization
4.  Oscilloscope plots of a received shot from each kit
5.  Discussion of differences between the two kits
6.  Description of anything that went wrong

Here is an example [report]({{media}}samplemilestone4report.pdf). -->

### M4 Statistical Report

**Produce a short report** summarizing the design and the results of
your statistical experiments. Include key equations, calculations and a
table summarizing your results. Include a list of several factors that
may be leading to the randomness of your outcomes. Draw conclusions on
your experiments. Finally, if you were to sell this product, how would
you market the range at which your laser tag system "works?"
