## Overview

In this task you will implement a debounce state machine for the
trigger, a transmitter driver, and a timer to flash LEDs when a hit is
detected. You will test each of these components with provided test code
to verify correct operation. In a later milestone, you will be guided
how to connect these components in a complete laser-tag system.

### Components

1.  **Trigger Debounce:** this state machine debounces a trigger
    press, which will be used to activate the transmitter driver.
1.  **Transmitter Driver:** this driver generates a square-wave signal
    on a GPIO pin at a user selectable frequency.
1.  **LED Timer:** this timer lights up the hit-indication LEDs on
    the laser-tag unit for 1/2 second each time a hit is detected.

### General Requirements

1.  Implement the trigger debounce state machine using the
    [approach]({% link docs/state-machine-code.md %}) taught in ECEN 330.
1.  When implementing components, follow the specifications.
1.  You must follow the [coding standard]({% link docs/coding-standard.md %}).
1.  You must demonstrate the behavior of your components to the TAs using
    the provided test code.

### General Notes

1.  Transmitter Frequencies: Use the frequencies listed in config.h:<br />
    {1250, 1481, 1739, 2000, 2353, 2667, 3077, 3333, 3636, 4000}
1.  Transmitter Pulse Length: 200 ms.
1.  System Tick Rate: 25 Hz (40 ms period).
1.  Hit LED Flash Time: 1/2 second.

{: .warning }
Only use integer types (uint16\_t, uint32\_t, int16\_t, etc.) in these
components. **DO NOT** use float or double types\! If you use them in
your tick functions, interrupt handlers, or timer event callbacks,
you may see very strange behavior in your system.

## Implementation

### Trigger Debounce

#### Specification

  - The trigger state machine must debounce both the _press and the
    release_ of the trigger switch (see [Algorithm](#algorithm)).
  - The GPIO pin connected to the trigger switch is given as a parameter
    to `trigger_init()`.
  - You read the current status of the trigger switch by reading the
    level of the connected GPIO pin.
  - Use the [ESP32 GPIO driver](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/gpio.html)
    to get the level of the trigger pin.
  - The trigger state machine recognizes the press of the trigger
    _after_ the press has been debounced.
  - The trigger state machine will not recognize another press of the
    trigger until the trigger has been released and debounced.
  - When transitioning from a released to a pressed state, a "pressed"
    callback function is called.
  - When transitioning from a pressed to a released state, a "released"
    callback function is called.

#### Detail

In `trigger_init()`, make sure that you configure the specified GPIO
pin properly as an input. You may want to consider using the
`gpio_reset_pin()` and `gpio_set_direction()` functions. Once the pin is
initialized you can use `gpio_get_level()` to read the trigger position
in the tick function. See this
[ESP32 GPIO example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v5.2.3/examples/peripherals/gpio/generic_gpio).

The trigger component uses callback functions to notify a user when the
trigger has been pressed or released. The function to be called must be
"registered" by the user with the trigger component and saved for later
use. This is done by passing a function pointer to a user function
(outside of trigger.c) as an argument to the `trigger_register_...()`
functions. These trigger register functions should only be called by an
external user of the trigger component and not from within. You will
need to create global variables to save the function pointer arguments.
If a callback function has not been registered, then no function should
be called for that event. See this reference on
[Pointers to functions](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Pointers_and_arrays#Pointers_to_Functions)
if needed.

#### Algorithm

Mechanical switches are imperfect when operated. When pressed or released
they often "bounce" between closed and open states for a short period
of time (10 milliseconds or so). For example, assume that a switch is
wired such that it is read as a '1' when pressed and read as a '0' when
released. If you continually read the switch when it is first pressed,
you may read the switch initially as a '1' but then a few milliseconds
later, read it as '0', then '1', then '0' and so forth. This process may
repeat itself a few times until the output of the switch becomes
completely stable. When a switch is initially pressed (or released) and
quickly changes values, we say that the switch "bounces".

We want our laser tag system to deliver exactly one shot for each
press/release of the trigger. The easiest way to debounce a switch is
to use a state machine that, in turn, uses a delay to determine when
the switch has stopped bouncing. Here is a simple algorithm you can
implement in a state machine and use to detect when a switch has
stopped bouncing. It assumes that it will take no longer than 40 ms (one
tick at the system tick rate) for the switch to stop bouncing. This is
a reasonable assumption for a switch that is in good working order.

  - Step 1: Wait until you detect a press of the switch.
  - Step 2: Once you detect the press of the switch, keep track of the
    elapsed time.
  - Step 3: If the switch changes value before the debounce time period
    is reached, reset the elapsed time and go to Step 1.
  - Step 4: If the debounce time period is reached and the switch has
    not changed value, assume that the switch is debounced.

You need to use this process for both the press and release of the
switch. A state machine with four states is a good choice, two for the
press and two for the release. As a suggestion, draw a state diagram
beginning with labeled circles for your states and then draw the
transitions between states. Finally, list any actions associated with a
state.

{: .important }
The logic level for the trigger switch in the laser-tag unit is inverted
from the example above. The trigger position is read as a '0' when
pressed and read as a '1' when released.

### Transmitter Driver

#### Specification

  - The transmitter driver generates a square-wave signal on a GPIO pin
    using the LED PWM (pulse width modulation) Controller on the ESP32.
  - The GPIO pin connected to the power LED is given as a parameter
    to `tx_init()`.
  - Configure the [ESP32 LED Control driver](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/ledc.html)
    to generate the signal on a GPIO pin.
  - A call to `tx_emit()` is used to start and stop generating a signal
    for indefinite time periods.
  - Each time the transmitter driver is activated with a call to
    `tx_pulse()`, it must generate the signal for the specified
    duration in ms.
  - Use a [FreeRTOS software timer](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/system/freertos_idf.html#timer-api)
    to determine the pulse time period.
  - The transmitter driver must be capable of generating signals
    between 1 and 5 kHz.
  - You set the signal frequency in Hertz with `tx_set_freq()`.
  - All generated signals must have a [50% duty cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_cycle).
  - The driver must ensure that the transmit GPIO pin is set to a level
    of '0' when inactive. Otherwise, the power LED connected to the
    transmit GPIO pin will constantly illuminate.

#### Detail

In `tx_init()`, configure an instance of an LEDC timer and an LEDC
channel. This [ESP32 LEDC example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v5.2.3/examples/peripherals/ledc/ledc_basic)
shows how to use the PWM hardware to generate a signal. The following
configuration values are known to work well for the transmitter driver.
Initially, set the duty cycle to 0% so that the transmitter is turned
off.

ledc_timer_config_t members
  - speed mode: LEDC_LOW_SPEED_MODE
  - timer number: LEDC_TIMER_0
  - duty resolution: LEDC_TIMER_8_BIT
  - initial frequency (Hz): 1000
  - clock configuration: LEDC_AUTO_CLK

ledc_channel_config_t members
  - speed mode: LEDC_LOW_SPEED_MODE
  - channel: LEDC_CHANNEL_0
  - timer select: LEDC_TIMER_0
  - interrupt type: LEDC_INTR_DISABLE
  - GPIO number: <the GPIO pin number passed to `tx_init()`>
  - duty cycle: 0
  - high point: 0

Also, `tx_init()` must create an instance of a FreeRTOS software timer
using `xTimerCreate()`. Configure the timer to be a one-shot timer.
See this [FreeRTOS software timer](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/system/freertos_idf.html#timer-api)
reference for an example of how to initialize and use the timer.

Signal generation is turned on and off with `tx_emit()`. The duty cycle
is set to 50% to turn on the transmitter and to 0% to turn off the
transmitter. Use `ledc_set_duty()` to set the duty cycle. A 50% duty
cycle can be specified with the following macro where `res` is the
duty resolution in bits (use 8 in this case):

```c
#define LEDC_DUTY_50(res) ((1U<<((res)-1))) // Set duty cycle to 50%
```

When implementing `tx_pulse()`, you can call `tx_emit(true)` to start
generating a signal. In addition, start a timer for the pulse duration
that has an expire action (a callback) that will stop the signal
generation with a call to `tx_emit(false)`. Use `xTimerChangePeriod()`
to set the timer period. The `tx_pulse()` function should return
immediately after starting the timer and signal generation, and not wait
for the timer to expire.

### LED Timer

#### Specification

  - When the LED timer is activated, it must illuminate the hit LEDs for
    the time period specified in the call to `hitLedTimer_init()`.
  - The GPIO pin connected to the hit LEDs is also given as a parameter
    to `hitLedTimer_init()`.
  - Use a [FreeRTOS software timer](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/system/freertos_idf.html#timer-api)
    to determine the active time period.
  - A call to `hitLedTimer_start()` activates the timer or restarts it
    from the beginning if currently active.
  - The default color for the LEDs when the timer is inactive is set
    with a call to `hitLedTimer_setColor()`.
  - The color of the LEDs when the timer is active is set with a call
    to `hitLedTimer_setHitColor()`.
  - When the timer has expired and is no longer active, the LEDs must be
    set back to the default color.
  - If not specified, the default color is BLACK and the hit color is WHITE.

#### Detail

In `hitLedTimer_init()`, call `neo_init()` to initialize the NeoPixel
driver. Make sure the LEDs are turned off (set to BLACK). Also, create
an instance of a FreeRTOS software timer using `xTimerCreate()`. Configure
the timer to be a one-shot timer with the period specified as a
parameter in `hitLedTimer_init()`.

Use `neo_write()` from the neo component to set the color of the NeoPixel
LEDs. See the neo.h header file for a description of the functions. Four
NeoPixel LEDs are integrated onto the laser-tag digital board and are
connected serially. Each are individually addressable. Two are located on
the front side of the board and two on the back side. Use a couple of
pixel arrays to hold the colors, 3 bytes for each NeoPixel.

```c
#define PIXEL_SZ 3
#define PIXEL_CNT 4
static uint8_t pixels_def[PIXEL_SZ*PIXEL_CNT]; // Default color
static uint8_t pixels_hit[PIXEL_SZ*PIXEL_CNT]; // Hit color
```

{: .important }
There is currently a problem with `xTimerIsTimerActive()` that prevents
it from being used to implement `hitLedTimer_running()`. Instead, use a
volatile global boolean flag for tracking when the timer is active. Set
the value as needed inside of the LED timer component.

## Other Help

### FreeRTOS Software Timer

<!-- ??Move following paragraph (and sketch) to a separate page?? -->
When using a FreeRTOS software timer, make sure to include the FreeRTOS
header and the timers header at the beginning of your file. Also, make
sure that you save a handle to the created timer globally so you can
access it in other functions within the file. The callback function
passed as an argument to `xTimerCreate()` must match the expected type.
In the sketch below, the `expire_actions()` callback function is an
example of this type.

```c
#include "freertos/FreeRTOS.h"
#include "freertos/timers.h"

static TimerHandle_t timer; // Declare timer handle

// Callback function called when the timer expires
static void expire_actions(TimerHandle_t pt)
{
}
```

### Macros for Debug

The following DPRINTF macro is a helpful alternative to the normal
printf function call since it can be switched off by making sure DEBUG
is not defined. If you have many DPRINTFs sprinkled throughout your
code, you can turn them all off at once while still leaving them in your
code for later use.

The DPCHAR macro is a low-overhead way to print a character to the
console. The macros can be left in the code for later test and debug,
but all of them can be disabled when running under normal use by not
having DEBUG defined (commended out).

Place the following code in your .c file near the top, but below other
\#include lines. Use DPRINTF just like you would printf.

```c
// Uncomment for debug prints
// #define DEBUG

#if defined(DEBUG)
#include <stdio.h>
#define DPRINTF(...) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
#define DPCHAR(ch) fputc(ch, stderr)
#else
#define DPRINTF(...)
#define DPCHAR(ch)
#endif
```

{: .note }
Be aware that if you print within your tick functions and your tick
functions are in turn called from a timer ISR (interrupt service routine),
you may get timer overruns and unusual behavior. A print function can
take a long time to execute relative to the timer period.

machines](docs/state-machine-code/#debugging-software-state-machines).

## Test Code

To pass off this task, you must run your code with the provided test
code. The test code calls functions in trigger.c, tx.c and in
hitLedTimer.c. The trigger test, will flash the NeoPixels as the trigger
is pressed ten times. When the NeoPixels turn red, the trigger disable
function is being tested. Keep operating the trigger during this period.
The transmitter test results are printed to the terminal window.
Finally, the hit LED timer should flash the NeoPixels for one-half second
on and off.

Before building the test code, first set the MILESTONE variable in
ltag/main/CMakeLists.txt to "m3t2".

```cmake
set(MILESTONE "m3t2")
```

Then, to build and run the tests, type the following:

```sh
idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
```

The test results printed to a terminal window on the host computer will
look like this if everything passes:

```
