## Overview

Now that you have designed your FIR and IIR filters using MATLAB, you
will implement these filters using C-code that executes on the the laser
tag unit. In support, you will also implement a delay line component
that allows retrieval of past filter sample values. You will verify the
correct operation of your filters using test code provided in the ECEN
390 project directory.

### Summary: What You Are Building

For Task 1, you are implementing just the signal processing component of
the receive path. The diagram below shows you the entire receive path.
You are implementing the part contained in the blue box, which consists
of the following sub components:

  - Delay Line: a memory buffer for filter samples. Samples are saved in
    the order received and are retrievable by index relative to the most
    recently saved.
  - State: storage for saving intermediate values for each IIR filter.
  - FIR Filter: the decimating, anti-aliasing FIR filter.
  - IIR Filter 0-9: the IIR bandpass filters.
  - Compute Energy 0-9: compute the amount of energy in the signal output
    from the corresponding IIR filter.

{: .note }
The IIR-Filter and associated Compute-Energy components are now numbered
0 - 9 in this task. This is because 'C' arrays are zero indexed and
starting at 0 makes coding easier. In MATLAB for Milestone 2, the
frequencies and IIR filters were numbered 1 - 10.

### General Requirements

  - Convert your filter coefficients developed in MATLAB to 'C' code.
  - You must implement all of the functions that are listed in delay.h
    and filter.h.
  - You must follow the [coding standard]({% link docs/coding-standard.md %}).
  - You must demonstrate the behavior of your filters to the TAs, using
    the provided source code.
  - Your FIR filter must have a reasonably flat frequency response up
    through 5 kHz and then should quickly roll off.
  - Your IIR filters must have a very narrow frequency response. For
    example, for frequency 4, your energy output should be high for
    IIR filter 4, but should be very low for all of the other
    IIR filters. A difference of 10X is preferred for good performance
    in the laser-tag game.
  - You will test your filter and energy-computation functions using
    the provided test code.

### General Notes

  - Assume a sample rate of 80 kHz for the input to the FIR filter.
  - The decimation rate for the FIR filter is 8.

### Filter Coefficients

To get started, you will need the filter coefficients from Milestone 2.
1.  One set of coefficients for the FIR filter code.
2.  Ten sets of coefficients for the IIR filter code.
    Each IIR coefficient set consists of a few second-order sections
    (which in turn consist of _b_ and _a_ coefficients).

  - ltag/components/histogram/histogram.c

These coefficient files can be created by running a provided MATLAB
conversion script.

  - ltag/main/coef.h
  - ltag/main/coef.c

You are expected to create and implement the following files. See the
provided header file (.h) for a description of each function.

  - ltag/main/delay.c
  - ltag/main/filter.c

{: .important }
When implementing each function, pay attention to the function
descriptions in the header files. In fact, save lost points from the
coding checker by copying the comments and function prototypes from the
header files to your .c files to start your code. Also, you are likely
to lose points from the coding checker if you modify the header files!
So, don't modify the provided header files.

## Implementation Details

### Convert Filter Coefficients to C Code

A MATLAB script is provided to assist you in converting your filter
coefficients developed in Milestone 2 to 'C' code.

Input:
  - FIR filter coefficients saved as a .mat file.
      - `FIR_b` is a 1 x _N_ vector of single-precision floating-point values.
  - IIR filter coefficients saved as a .mat file.
      - `IIR_sos` is an _F_ element cell array of _S_ x 6 single-precision matrices.
      - _F_ is the number of IIR filters, one for each player frequency.
      - _S_ is the number of second-order sections in the filter.
      - Each section contains 6 coefficients {b0, b1, b2, 1, a1, a2}.

Output:
  - coef.h - header file with array declarations and #defines for sizes.
  - coef.c - 'C' file with initialized arrays named `fir_b` and `iir_sos`.
      - Each second-order section contains 5 coefficients {b0, b1, b2, a1, a2}.
          - The first _a_ coefficient equal to 1 is dropped.

The process is simple if the above input assumptions apply to your saved
MATLAB coefficients. If not, you can modify your MATLAB code or modify the
conversion script so that they match.

Instructions:
  - Download the MATLAB script [coef.m]({{media}}coef.m) into the same
    directory you used to design your filters.
  - Run the script to format your coefficients into 'C' arrays.
  - Copy or move the generated coef.h and coef.c files to
    your ecen390/ltag/main directory.
  - When implementing filter.c, include coef.h at the top of your file
    so you can access the filter coefficients.

### Delay Code

The delay component implements a delay line. It acts like an array of
elements of size _N_ that gets shifted down (to the next higher index)
each time a new element is saved at index zero. The last element in the
array falls off the end when shifted. An element retrieved from index
zero is the most recent element saved. Each higher index goes back in
time by one time step. The actual implementation uses a circular buffer.

In `delay_init()`, use `malloc()` to allocate memory for the delay line
and then check to see if the allocation failed. Also, make sure that the
allocated memory is initialized to zero. `malloc()` does not initialize
the returned memory to zero.

```c
/* in delay_init() */
d->data = malloc(size * sizeof(delay_data_t));
if (d->data == NULL) abort();
```

The `pos` member of the delay_t struct, should be initialized to zero.
When a new value is saved to the delay line, decrement the position `pos`
and then store the value. If a decrement would cause the position to go
negative, wrap around and set the position to the delay line size (in
elements) minus one.

{: .warning }
Do not implement the delay component by shifting values. It will be too
slow!

### Filter Initialization

As each signal sample is processed through the filter stages, memory is
needed by each filter to keep a running history of sample values to
multiply against the filter coefficients. Additionally, for an IIR
filter, memory or "state" is needed to hold feedback from the output. To
compute the energy in the output signal of each IIR filter, a history,
or sliding window, of sample values is also needed. Use instances of the
delay component to maintain the history of values needed for the FIR
filter and energy computation. There should be one instance for the FIR
filter and an array of instances for the energy computations. For the
IIR filter, use a 3D array to hold the state. The size of the first
dimension is the number of filters, the second is the number of
second-order sections, and the third is the number of state variables.

```c
#define SOS_STATE 4 // Number of state variables per second-order section
static filter_data_t iir_state[IIR_FILTERS][IIR_SOS_SECTS][SOS_STATE];
```

Use `filter_init()` to initialize each instance of the delay component
by calling `delay_init()`. Also, initialize an array of current energy
values to hold the output of the energy computation, one array element
for each IIR filter.

The `filter_reset()` function only sets the delay and state memories to
zero without allocating memory. It should call `delay_reset()` to reset
the delay instances. The 3D array of IIR state can be set to zero with
one call to the `memset()` function. Also, set the current energy values
to zero.

### Filter Code

#### Background

In this task you will implement the FIR and IIR filters that you
designed with MATLAB in 'C' code. Let's start with the FIR filter.
Remember that the FIR filter is implemented as a weighted sum of some
past number of inputs. Here's an example from Wikipedia:

![]({{media}}firexamplefromwikipedia.jpg)

It can be confusing to transition from the finite array-based approach
used in MATLAB to the "infinite" approach that is required in the
implementation of a signal-processing system. The inputs and outputs of
a real-time signal-processing system are essentially infinite. As such,
the array-based notation in the equation above fails us because the
output is an indexed array `y[n]`. For example, at time=0, you start out
computing `y[0]`. After playing the game for several minutes, `n` would
be in the billions. And, it only goes up from there. Simply put, you
want to eliminate the `[n]` part so that the output is simply `y`.

Note that in the English-based description from Wikipedia (see above),
indexes were not discussed. Remember that the FIR filter is implemented
as a "weighted-sum of some _past_ number of inputs". All those indexes,
the `i`, the `k`, etc., are just a way to keep the coefficients properly
aligned with the data. The goal is to keep the recent history of input
values aligned with the coefficients.

The idea is pretty simple and is based upon these ideas:

1.  Create a delay line structure that will keep an ordered history of
    past values. The size of the data structure must match the order of
    the filter, e.g., a 50-tap FIR filter needs a history of 50 values.
2.  At start-up time, initialize the delay line with zeros.
3.  As each new value arrives, throw away the oldest value.
4.  Read the stored, past values from the delay line and multiply
    them with the correct coefficients.

#### FIR Filter

You can implement a FIR filter using the delay line as described above.
Consider an example where the FIR filter uses _N_ of the most recent
input values to compute its output. _N_ is equal to the number of _b_
coefficients.

Assume: 
  - `fir_b` is an array of _b_ coefficients for the FIR filter
  - `FIR_B_COEFS` is the number of _b_ coefficients in `fir_b`
  - `fDelay` is a delay line of size `FIR_B_COEFS` holding the most
     recent samples
  - `in` is the most recent sample from an ADC
  - `output` is the filter output for the current time step

```c
#include "coef.h"
#include "delay.h"
#include "filter.h"

  ...
  delay_save(&fDelay, in);
  filter_data_t output = (filter_data_t)0.0;
  for (delay_size_t i = 0; i < FIR_B_COEFS; i++) {
    output += delay_read(&fDelay, i) * fir_b[i];
  }
  ...
```

<!-- Pictorially, implementing the FIR filter would appear as shown below. As
shown, you can see the 4 values that were pushed onto the queue as well
as the total computations.

![]({{media}}firqueueexample1.jpg)

The next computation of y is shown below. You can see that by adding a
new value to the queue, all of the other values shifted over, relative
to the `b` coefficients. Thus you can use the same code to compute `y`
over and over again.

![]({{media}}firqueueexample2.jpg) -->

The purpose of the delay line is to store past values in the
order that they were received and make all of the contained values
accessible during the filter computation.

#### What About Decimation?

Decimation is really easy. In our laser-tag system, we will be decimating
by 8. All we do is invoke our FIR filter each time we receive 8 new
samples. As you save incoming samples to the FIR-filter delay line, only
invoke the FIR filter each time you have received 8 new inputs. Use the
`run` argument to `filter_firFilter()` to control when it should invoke
the filter. This function should be called for each new input sample so
it can be saved in the delay line, but `run` should only be true for
every 8th sample.

#### IIR Filters

The difference equation (Direct Form I) for a second-order section of an
IIR filter is shown below.

```
y[n] = b0 * x[n] + b1 * x[n-1] + b2 * x[n-2] - a1 * y[n-1] - a2 * y[n-2]
```

IIR filters of higher order are implemented as a cascade of second-order
sections.

The implementation of the IIR filter is similar to the FIR filter.
However, the IIR filter relies on two signal histories: _x_ and _y_, as
shown in the equation above. As you can see from the equation, you would
need two delay lines to keep the necessary signal histories. The only
other difference is that the computed value _y_ is also saved to the
delay line that keeps a history of _y_ values. This is essentially what
puts the "IIR" in the filter, e.g, feedback.

For the IIR filters, we will not be using the delay component for the
signal histories, but rather a 3D array as described in
[Filter Initialization](#filter-initialization).
In this case, we will be shifting the values in the "state" memory as a
part of the filter code.

Below is a sketch of code that shows you how to "cascade" each of the
second-order sections together apply the IIR filter to one incoming
sample.

```c
filter_data_t filter_iirFilter(uint16_t chan, filter_data_t in)
{
	...
	// Cascade the results of each second-order section
	for (int8_t section = 0; section < IIR_SOS_SECTS; section++) {
		...
		const float *c = iir_sos[chan][section]; // 5 coefficients
		float *w = iir_state[chan][section]; // State variables
		...
	}
	...
}
```

The temporary pointers _c_ and _w_ point to the coefficients and state
variables need for the section being processed.

  - _c_: {b0, b1, b2, a1, a2} coefficients, `c[0]` is b0
  - _w_: {x\[n-1\], x\[n-2\], y\[n-1\], y\[n-2\]} state, `w[0]` is x\[n-1\]

Again, elements of the _w_ array (e.g. `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ...) will need to
be shifted as a part of your IIR filter code for each sample processed.

Other forms of the IIR filter can be implemented with the advantage of
only needing two state variables per section:

  - [Direct Form II](https://schaumont.dyn.wpi.edu/ece4703b21/lecture3.html#cascade-iir-example)
  - [Direct Form II Transpose](https://schaumont.dyn.wpi.edu/ece4703b21/lecture3.html#transposed-structures)

### Computing Energy

Implement all of the energy-related functions (they all have the word
"Energy" in their names). You will need to make sure to implement
`filter_computeEnergy()` with an incremental approach so that it does not
take too much execution time. Carefully think about how you might be
able to reuse computations performed in a previous invocation of
`filter_computeEnergy()` to reduce overall computation time.

To compute energy, you must keep a running history of 200 ms of output
data from each of the IIR bandpass filters. Use a delay line instance for
each IIR filter to hold this data. The size should be sufficient to hold
200 ms of samples. The energy for a signal contained in a delay line is
the sum of the squares of all values.

Incrementally compute the energy from sample values contained in the
energy delay lines. Since the delay lines `eDelay[chan]` and current
energy values `currentEnergy[chan]` are initialized to zero, the
incremental approach described below works from the start.
Implementation sketch:

1.  Read the oldest value from the delay line `eDelay[chan]` and call this `old`.
2.  Save the newest value `in`, passed as an argument, to the delay line.
3.  Compute a new energy as: `currentEnergy[chan] - (old * old) + (in * in)`.
4.  Save this energy as the `currentEnergy[chan]` and also return it.

Note that this function will need a global array `currentEnergy[chan]` to
keep track of the current energy for each of the energy buffers.

Implement the `filter_getEnergyArray()` function which retrieves a copy
of the current energy values. This function copies the already computed
values into a previously-declared array so that they can be accessed from
outside the filter pipeline by the detector. Remember that when you pass
an array into a 'C' function, changes to the array within that function
are reflected in the returned array.

### Filter Pipeline

All the parts of the filter pipeline are brought together in the
`filter_addSample()` function. This function adds a new sample to the
filter pipeline and then runs each of the stages as necessary: decimating
FIR filter, IIR filters, power computation. The filters are run when the
sample count is a multiple of the decimation factor. The result of each
power computation is saved internally and is retrievable with one of the
getEnergy functions. `filter_addSample()` returns true if the filters
were run.

Assume that this code is called whenever there is a new scaled ADC value
available.

```c
bool filter_addSample(filter_data_t in)
{
    static uint32_t sample_cnt = 0;
    bool run = ++sample_cnt == FILTER_FIR_DECIMATION_FACTOR;

    // Call the FIR filter function with the latest input sample
       // Set the run argument to true if the decimation factor was reached.
    // If run is true
       // Reset the sample count to zero
       // Run all the IIR filters and compute energy
    // End if
    // Return true if the filters were run
}
```

## Test Code

To pass off this task, you must run your code with the provided test
code. The test code calls functions in delay.c and in filter.c It also
plots the frequency response for the FIR and IIR filters on the LCD
display. In filter.h, you will see a section of code labeled
"Verification-Assisting Functions". These support functions provide a
way for the test code to access the filter coefficients used in your
filter.c code. These must be implemented.

Before building the test code, first set the MILESTONE variable in
ltag/main/CMakeLists.txt to "m3t1".

```cmake
set(MILESTONE "m3t1")
```

Then, to build and run the tests, type the following:

```sh
idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
```

The test results printed to a terminal window on the host computer will
look like this if everything passes:

```
******** test_delay() ********
initialization test
save and read test
read out-of-bound test
reset test
******** test_delay() Done ********

******** test_filter() ********
filter_firFilter() alignment test
filter_firFilter() arithmetic test
filter_computeEnergy() test
filter_addSample() test
filter_addSample() average time:17 us
******** test_filter() Done ********
```

{: .note }
The "alignment test" checks that coefficient values are multiplied with
corresponding delay line values using correct indices.

Along with the test results printed to a terminal window, the frequency response
of the filters will be plotted on the LCD display.
<!-- You can compare your results to those on this
[page](http://ece390web.groups.et.byu.net/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=frequency_response_plots).
Your results should look similar. -->

-----

## Pass Off and Code Submission

  - You will show the TAs how your code behaves when running the
    provided test code. The test results will be displayed in a terminal
    window on the host computer. You will also show the TAs the information
    displayed on the laser-tag unit LCD.
  - You will submit your source code by doing the following: 
    1.  From the top-level directory (e.g., ecen390), run
        `./check_and_zip.py m3t1`.
    2.  The resulting .zip file will be in the top-level directory.
        Submit that to Learning Suite.
    3.  Submit only one .zip file per group. Both group members will
        receive credit.

-----

## Notes to TAs

Please pay attention to the following:

1.  Check to make sure that both of the delay and filter tests pass.
2.  Check to make sure that the plots on the LCD display look correct,
    e.g., the FIR-filter is flat across the frequency range and that the
    bandpass filters have a narrow response.
