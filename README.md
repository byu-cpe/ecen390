## ABET Notes for Faculty

ECEN 390 needs to provide the following data annually for ABET purposes.

  - Communication (Outcome 3): Grades for a video submitted by each group that demonstrates their final creative project. Export the grades for "M6 Report". The links to these videos should be archived.

  - Teamwork (Outcome 5): Overall assessment of milestone achievement. For this, export the "Final" grades for the course as a percentage. Most all assignments (pass-offs, code, and reports) are submitted on a per group basis. Everyone in the group receives the same score. Assessments are used to ensure that groups are progressing satisfactorily throughout the semester.

  - Experiments and Analysis (Outcome 6): Grades for a statistical analysis report submitted by each group summarizing the design and results of their experiments. Export the grades for "M4 Statistical Report", which was done as a part of Milestone 4.
