## Basic Functions

  - len
  - plot
  - subplot
  - hold
  - sin
  - square
  - xlim
  - ylim

You can type `help <name>` to get a description of the
particular function.

Let's do an example to use these basic functions. We are going to plot 4
different signals on 2 separate plots.

  - Plot 1 will contain a square wave and sine waves with amplitude of 2
    and frequency of f=1 kHz.
  - Plot 2 will contain a square wave and sine waves with amplitude of 2
    and frequency of f=10 kHz.

Here is the MATLAB code for the first plot.

```m
f1 = 1e3;
fs = 100e3;
t  = 0:1/fs:10/f1;
y1 = sin(2*pi*f1*t);
y2 = square(2*pi*f1*t);

subplot(2,1,1);
hold off;
plot(t*1e3,y1,'b');
hold on;
plot(t*1e3,y2,'r');
hold off;
ylabel('amplitude');
xlabel('time (ms)');
ylim([-1.2 1.2]);
```

Here is a description of the MATLAB code.

1.  We use a variable for the signal frequency (*f1*) and the sampling
    frequency (*fs*).
2.  We create a vector for the time (*t*). It has an increment of the
    sample period (1/fs) with a duration of 10 signal periods (*10/f1*).
3.  We create the vectors for the sine and square waves.
4.  We use the *subplot* function to plot the signals in the upper half
    of the plot window.
5.  The *hold on* makes it so that the next plot function call overlays
    onto the same plot. *hold off* does the opposite.
6.  Use *xlabel* and *ylabel* to add in axes.

The second part of the code is similar and just changes the frequency,
the time, and the plot location. Here is the resulting MATLAB code.

```m
f2 = 10e3;
t  = 0:1/fs:10/f2;
y3 = sin(2*pi*f2*t);
y4 = square(2*pi*f2*t);

subplot(2,1,2);
hold off;
plot(t*1e3,y3,'b');
hold on;
plot(t*1e3,y4,'r');
hold off;
ylabel('amplitude');
xlabel('time (ms)');
ylim([-1.2 1.2]);
```

The resulting plot should look like the following. ![]({{media}}example1.jpg)

## Filtering Function Help

  - butter: Butterworth filter design
  - filter: Time domain filtering of a signal
  - fft: Fast Fourier Transform
  - freqz: complex frequency response of a digital filter

### butter

Start by typing

```m
help butter
```

on the MATLAB command line. Read through the description. Let's look at
parts of the description and what it means.

**Description**: "butter Butterworth digital and analog filter design."

**Why we care**: We are designing a digital filter so this should help.

**Description**: "\[B,A\] = butter(N,Wn) designs an Nth order lowpass
digital Butterworth filter and returns the filter coefficients in length
N+1 vectors B (numerator) and A (denominator)."

**Why we care**: The B (numerator) and A (denominator) coefficients
means that it calculates the coefficients of an IIR filter (see [IIR](
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response)).

**Description**: "The cutoff frequency Wn must be 0.0 \< Wn \< 1.0, with
1.0 corresponding to half the sample rate."

**Why we care**: When we design the cutoff frequencies we divide our
desired cutoff frequency by half the sample rate to get it into the
correct form for the butter function.

**Description**: "If Wn is a two-element vector, Wn = \[W1 W2\], butter
returns an order 2N bandpass filter with passband W1 \< W \< W2."

**Why we care**: Rather than simply designing a lowpass filter we can
calculate the IIR filter coefficients for a bandpass filter, which is
what we want.

### filter

Type

```m
help filter
```

on the MATLAB command line. Read through the description. Let's look at
parts of the description and what it means.

**Description**: "One-dimensional digital filter."

**Why we care**: We want to do a one dimensional filter so it looks like
we have the correct function.

**Description**: "Y = filter(B,A,X) filters the data in vector X with
the filter described by vectors A and B to create the filtered data Y."

**Why we care**: Our sampled data is the X vector and the resulting
sampled data is the Y vector.

**Description**: "If a(1) is not equal to 1, filter normalizes the
filter coefficients by a(1)."

**Why we care**: We need to make sure that the first element of our a
vector is equal to 1.

### fft

MATLAB has a function for performing numerical Fourier transforms called
the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The FFT is actually a discrete Fourier
transform (DFT). We can relate the DFT to the continuous time domain.
This [FFT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7X6jgFnB6Y) explains
the conversion between the time and frequency domains. MATLAB also has
some help on using the FFT. In the command window type

```m
help fft
```

More detailed [MATLAB fft documentation](
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fft.html) is available
online.

### freqz

Let's go through the MATLAB help and find the portions that are the most
pertinent. Start by typing

```m
help freqz
```

**Description**: "freqz Frequency response of digital filter."

**Why we care**: We want the frequency response of a digital filter. So
it looks like we found the correct MATLAB function.

**Description**: "\[H,W\] = freqz(B,A,N) returns the N-point complex
frequency response vector H and the N-point frequency vector W in
radians/sample of the filter:"

**Why we care**: H is the complex frequency response. N is the number of
points that are calculated.

We don't really want the plot in terms of radians/sample. We would
prefer to create the plot in terms of frequency. So we are going to scan
down the description until we find the form of freqz that is in terms of
frequency.

**Description**: "H = freqz(...,F,Fs) returns the complex frequency
response at the frequencies designated in vector F (in Hz), where Fs is
the sampling frequency (in Hz)."

**Why we care**: This tells us how to create the plot in terms of
frequency rather than samples.

## Filtering Function Examples

### Using butter and filter

Let's do a simple example to make sure that we understand how to use the
butter and filter MATLAB functions.

We are going to start with a lowpass filter to make sure that we have
the cutoff frequency set properly.

Plot a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of f1=1kHz, sampling frequency
of Fs=10e3, and plot 10 periods of the signal.

```m
Fs = 10e3;
f1 = 1e3;
t = 0:1/Fs:10/f1;
x1 = sin(2*pi*f1*t);
plot(t,x1);
```

You should get a plot that looks like:

![]({{media}}matlab_help_fig1.jpg)

If we create a lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of *fcut=1.5kHz*
then the signal should pass through the filter. Let's make some mistakes
and see what happens and see if we can figure out what we did wrong. We
are doing this to learn about debugging.

**Mistake**: Pass the cutoff frequency as the actual frequency.

```m
Wn = 1.5e3;
[B,A] = butter(5,Wn);
```

We get an error message that says "â€¦cutoff frequencies must be within the
interval of (0,1)." We would type help butter and find out that "Wn must
be 0.0 \< Wn \< 1.0, with 1.0 corresponding to half the sample rate."

**Mistake**: Divide the cutoff frequency by Fs rather than Fs/2.

```m
Wn = 1.5e3;
Wn = Wn/(Fs);
[B,A] = butter(5,Wn);

y = filter(B,A,x1);

subplot(2,1,1);
plot(t,x1);
ylabel('original');

subplot(2,1,2);
plot(t,y);
ylabel('filtered');
```

The resulting plot should look something like:

![]({{media}}matlab_help_fig2.jpg)

The signal y has a lower amplitude. This means that it is being filtered.
We must have made an error in the cutoff frequency. If we make the
following change

```m
Wn = Wn/(2*Fs);
```

The following plot shows that it is now worse because we were supposed
to divide by Fs/2 not 2\*Fs.

![]({{media}}matlab_help_fig3.jpg)

The correct value is

```m
Wn = Wn/(Fs/2);
```

Resulting in the correct plot.

![]({{media}}matlab_help_fig4.jpg)

To finish up let's make sure that we can use the butter function to
create a bandpass filter. Start with a signal that is x=sin(2\*pi\*1e3\*t)
+ sin(2\*pi\*2e3\*t) + sin(2\*pi\*3e3\*t) and has the a sampling
frequency of Fs=10kHz. Use a bandpass filter to pass the f=2kHz signal
through and attenuate the other two. The resulting plots should look
like the following.

### Using fft

Let's go through an example besides the one provided in the MATLAB
help to make sure that you understand how to use the FFT.

You need to create a frequency domain plot of a sinusoidal signal with
frequency of f1=3 kHz and amplitude of 1. We are using a sinusoidal
signal because we know that the Fourier transform of a sine wave is a
delta function. So the FFT should produce a spike at a frequency of 3
kHz and have an amplitude of 1.

Here is the MATLAB code to create the time signal

```m
Fs = 100e3; % sample rate
f1 = 3e3;   % signal frequency
A1 = 1;     % signal amplitude, peak amplitude not peak-to-peak
t  = 0 : 1/Fs : 10/f1;
y  = A1*sin(2*pi*f1*t);
```

Here is the plot of our signal.

![]({{media}}fft_example1.jpg)

Now you need to create the Fourier transform of the signal using the
MATLAB fft function.

```m
Y = fft(y);
plot(abs(Y));
```

Notice that we plotted the absolute value of Y since it is complex.

![]({{media}}fft_example2.jpg)

Notice that there are two spikes and that the amplitude is not equal to
our amplitude of 1.

Let's start with the frequency. We only want the positive frequencies so
we are only going to use the first half of the vector. We know that
maximum frequency of a sampled signal is Fs/2. So we create an x-axis
vector that goes from 0 to Fs/2 and has a length of half of Y. Here is
the resulting MATLAB code.

```m
L  = length(Y);            % the total length of our fft
Y1 = Y(1:L/2);             % take the first half of the vector
f  = linspace(0,Fs/2,L/2); % create the frequency vector
plot(f,abs(Y1));
```

The `linspace` function creates a vector with equally spaced elements
between a starting and an ending value and with a specified number of
elements. Here is the resulting plot.

![]({{media}}fft_example3.jpg)

You can zoom in on the spike and verify that it has a frequency close to
3kHz.

Our signal does not have an amplitude greater than 100 so we obviously
need to scale the amplitude. We simply need to divide the signal by the
number of elements.

```m
Y2 = Y1/(L/2);
plot(f,abs(Y2));
```

Here is the resulting plot.

![]({{media}}fft_example4.jpg)

Zoom in on the spike to make sure that it is centered close to 3kHz.

{: .note }
As you learned by watching the [FFT
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7X6jgFnB6Y), the FFT creates an
array of frequency domain spectrum samples. The number of samples is the
same as the length of your data (N) and the frequency range is based on
the sampling frequency fmax=Fs/2. This means that the frequency bin is
Fs/(2\*N).

In our example the number of samples is L/2=167 and the frequency band
is Fs/2=50kHz. This means that our frequency resolution is 299.4 Hz. If
we increase the number of points in our time domain signal without
increasing the total time of the signal then we are actually changing the
sampling frequency, which would increase our total frequency band but
not change our frequency resolution. In order to change the resolution
we need to increase the total time width of our signal without changing
the sampling frequency.

This MATLAB code produces a sine wave with 10 periods and a
corresponding frequency resolution of 299 Hz.

```m
Fs = 100e3; % sample rate
f1 = 3e3;   % signal frequency
A1 = 1;     % signal amplitude, peak amplitude not peak-to-peak
t  = 0:1/Fs:10/f1;
y  = A1*sin(2*pi*f1*t);
Y  = fft(y);
L  = length(Y); % the total length of our fft
Y1 = Y(1:L/2);  % take the first half of the vector
Y2 = Y1/(L/2);
f  = linspace(0,Fs/2,L/2);
subplot(2,1,1);
plot(t,y);
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(f,abs(Y2));
```

Here are the resulting time domain and frequency domain plots.

![]({{media}}fft_example5.jpg)

This MATLAB code produces a sine wave with 100 periods and a
corresponding frequency resolution of 29.9 Hz.

```m
Fs = 100e3; % sample rate
f1 = 3e3;   % signal frequency
A1 = 1;     % signal amplitude, peak amplitude not peak-to-peak
t  = 0:1/Fs:100/f1;
y  = A1*sin(2*pi*f1*t);
Y  = fft(y);
L  = length(Y); % the total length of our fft
Y1 = Y(1:L/2);  % take the first half of the vector
Y2 = Y1/(L/2);
f  = linspace(0,Fs/2,L/2);
subplot(2,1,1);
plot(t,y);
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(f,abs(Y2));
```

Here are the resulting plots.

### Using freqz

Here is an example to show how to use the freqz function.

(1) We need to create the filter.

```m
Fs = 10e3;      % sample rate of 10kHz
Wn = [1e3 2e3]; % bandpass filter with 1kHz < f < 2kHz
Wn = Wn/(Fs/2); % divide by half of the sampling frequency

[B,A] = butter(4,Wn); % create the filter
```

(2) Set up the frequency vector.

```m
F = 0:Fs/(1000):Fs/2; % create the array of frequencies
```

In this example we are creating an array of frequencies between 0 and
the maximum frequency, which is half of the sampling frequency.

(3) Use the freqz function to create the complex frequency response.

```m
H = freqz(B,A,F,Fs); % create the complex frequency response
```

(4) Plot the magnitude of the complex frequency response.

```m
plot(F,abs(H));
```

Here is the resulting plot.

![]({{media}}freqz_1.jpg)

Notice how the filter is flat over the band between the two frequencies
and then slopes down outside of this band. This is the shape of the
frequency response of a bandpass filter.

Often the data is scaled to be in decibels so that it is easier to
distinguish small changes. When you do this you often need to scale the
y-axis of the plot to your desired range of interest.

```m
H_db = 20*log10(abs(H));
plot(F,H_db);
axis([0 5000 -50 3]);
```

Here is the plot in decibel scale. You can zoom in on the 1kHz and 2kHz
frequencies and see that these are the 3dB points.

![]({{media}}freqz_3.jpg)

You can change the order of the filter and see that the filter becomes
steeper and change the frequency corners and see the change in the width
of the filter.
